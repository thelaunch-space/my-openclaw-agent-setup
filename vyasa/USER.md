# About Your Boss: Krishna Goutham

## Who Krishna Is

Krishna is the solo founder of thelaunch.space - an AI-first execution studio that converts founder ideas into shipped products in weeks.

- Former EdTech leader: 9+ years at BYJU'S, AVP level, 300+ person team
- Non-developer who builds production software through prompting - 65 projects in 14 months
- Expert in Claude Code, Anthropic API, CLI-based AI tools, Supabase
- Runs end-to-end tech for small businesses

## Unfair Advantages

1. **Product thinking** — Don't just build; think strategically about what to build and why
2. **Non-dev who builds** — Understand founder pain firsthand because I AM a non-technical founder who ships
3. **Education background** — 10 years teaching/curriculum design. Can explain and teach, not just deliver
4. **Speed + quality combo** — Ship as fast as anyone but with production-grade quality

## Skills (for credible content topics)

- **Expert:** Prompt engineering, Bolt.new, vibe-coding, product strategy, MVP methodology, curriculum design
- **Proficient:** Claude/OpenAI APIs, Supabase, Convex, Make.com, Cursor, Claude Code, Netlify, AI-UX design
- **Intermediate:** SQL, database schema, GitHub, LLM fine-tuning
- **Learning:** CI/CD, Docker, RAG, serverless, MLOps

## What thelaunch.space Does

Ships MVPs, landing pages, and AI tools for non-technical founders. Thinks like a cofounder, builds like a CTO.

- **Services:** MVPs ($1,500-$4,000), Landing Pages ($500-$1,500), Growth Partnerships ($2,000-$5,000/mo)
- **Tagline:** "21 days. idea to revenue."
- **Close rate:** 80% (8/10 founders converted)
- **Bottleneck:** Lead generation - top of funnel is the constraint. Sales is NOT the problem.

## Proof Points

**Marquee Client:** Beacon House (14+ month retainer) — education consultancy focused on Ivy League admissions. Built their entire digital infrastructure.

**Speed examples:**
- DirectShelf: D2C investor demo — 1-day turnaround
- Benzorgo PWA: Field sales app for 40+ reps — 3-4 week delivery
- Tripture Travel: Instagram growth — 200 followers/week

**Scale examples:**
- Wise Tutor: 50+ lesson plans generated before retiring
- PDFtoQuickBooks: Saves bookkeepers 5+ hours/week
- Bolt.new: CEO reached out; wrote official curriculum

**Mentoring:** Coached a non-technical PM to land a $500 gig in 14 days, now doing high-ticket projects

## Verticals with Proven Experience

Use for lead qualification — Krishna has shipped in these domains:
- **Education / EdTech** (Beacon House, Wise Tutor, Capstone, Universal Education)
- **Healthcare / Pharma** (VitalyF, Benzorgo Sales Officer PWA)
- **D2C / E-commerce** (DirectShelf, UGC Factory)
- **Finance / Invoicing** (EasyInvoice, PDFtoQuickBooks, AdvisorIQ)
- **AI / Developer Tools** (First Prompt, Bolt.new curriculum, X Growth Engine, OpenClaw)
- **Travel** (Tripture Travel)
- **Community** (LetsPOAI)

## Krishna's Ideal Client (ICP)

Domain-expert founders, aged 35-50, who've transitioned from corporate or had a startup exit. Running premium services businesses ($30K-$2M revenue) in education, healthcare, legal, finance, or professional services.

**Key traits:**
- HIGH awareness that AI can transform their business, LOW clarity on implementation
- Value speed over cost, partnership over vendor relationships
- Done waiting 6 months for agencies to deliver mediocre work
- Non-technical but deeply smart in their domain

**Example archetypes:**
- 45-year-old ex-McKinsey partner running a boutique strategy consultancy
- 40-year-old exited founder building a premium admissions consulting firm
- 38-year-old executive coach wanting to scale their proprietary framework
- 50-year-old running a law firm watching younger competitors use tech

**Red flags (NOT a fit):**
- "I need it cheap" - cost over value
- "I have detailed specs" - wants order-taker, not partner
- "We need to involve our IT team" - enterprise process
- Pre-revenue with no budget

## Where to Find Leads

| Channel | Signal to Watch For |
|---------|-------------------|
| LinkedIn | Domain experts posting about operational struggles, scaling challenges, or AI curiosity |
| X/Twitter | Non-tech founders building in public, complaining about agencies, asking about AI tools |
| Reddit | r/entrepreneur, r/smallbusiness, r/startups - posts about needing tech help, AI confusion |
| Job boards | Non-tech companies hiring for CTO/dev roles = buying signal (they need tech but can't build it) |
| Startup news | Funding announcements for services companies, domain-expert founders in the news |
| Podcasts | Industry-specific podcasts featuring domain experts talking about scaling challenges |

## How Krishna Works

- **Outcome-first:** Starts from desired result, works backward
- **Workflow-centric:** Visualizes real human behavior before designing
- **Bias for simplification:** Clarity over feature-richness
- **Pragmatic iteration:** Ship early, gather feedback, cycle quickly
- **Marketing is a weakness:** Finds self-promotion uncomfortable, deprioritizes it (this is why YOU exist)

## Communication Preferences

- One step at a time
- Plain English, no jargon
- Use business analogies, not tech analogies
- Ask clarifying questions rather than assume
- Krishna reviews and approves everything before it goes live - always human in the loop

## Krishna's Content Voice (Summary)

- Calm confidence, not performative
- Practitioner-first: peer who builds, not guru who preaches
- Honest about limitations
- Evidence-led: "In my experience...", "I found that..."
- No em dashes, no "game-changer", no guru/salesy language
- Specific tools, numbers, timeframes always included
- See the full writing-voice-guide.md for detailed rules

## Business Goals (2026)

- Revenue target: $100-150k/year (~$8-12k/month)
- Current: Under $2k/month (need 4-6x growth)
- Model: 2-3 retainer clients + 1-2 projects/month
- Grow X from 1,200 to meaningful following
- Establish thought leadership in "non-dev who builds" space
- Workshops track: Schools for visibility, corporate for high-ticket revenue

## What Energizes Krishna

1. Building products (most energizing)
2. Strategy/consulting
3. Teaching/mentoring
4. Client delivery (wants to eventually delegate)

## What Drains Krishna

- Marketing and self-promotion (but actively working to change this — running first structured outbound sprint Jan-Feb 2026)
- Ongoing maintenance without new challenges
- Bureaucratic processes
