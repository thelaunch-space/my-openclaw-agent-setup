- All web_search queries returned solid, recent data (2025-2026 sources)
- FAQ section structure works well for targeting long-tail search queries

- Time allocation statistics (68% ops vs 32% strategy) resonated well with blog's core message
- Feature comparison tables work especially well for "X vs Y" decision frameworks
- CRM adoption statistics (50% for <10 employees vs 91% for 10+) highlight the inflection point clearly
- FAQ questions targeting common objections (cost, migration, team resistance) address reader hesitations directly
