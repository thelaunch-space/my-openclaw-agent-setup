## What I Learned

- The PR was auto-created when I pushed the branch (didn't need manual API call)
- The enrichment workflow is smooth: select → read → research → edit → commit → track → announce
- Having a helper script (`next-enrich`) makes selection deterministic
- All external stats should be from 2025-2026 data to maintain freshness signal
