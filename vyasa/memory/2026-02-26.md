- The enrichment workflow is smooth: select → read → research → edit → commit → track → announce
- Having a helper script (`next-enrich`) makes selection deterministic
- All external stats should be from 2025-2026 data to maintain freshness signal

## Enrichment Run #3 (8 PM IST / 2:30 PM UTC)

**Selected blog:** Why Your Agency Wasted $30K on Your MVP
- Row 7 in blog-queue
- Previously enriched on 2026-02-20 (6 days ago)
- Enrichment count before: 1
- Published URL: https://thelaunch.space/blogs/startup-mvps/why-agency-mvp-failed

### Enrichment Added

**Statistics & Insights (4 new data points):**
1. **92% pivot rate** - 92% of startups pivot at least once before finding product-market fit, averaging 1.8 pivots (Failory 2025)
2. **3.6x better growth** - Startups that pivot 1-2 times experience 3.6x better user growth and raise 2.5x more money
3. **85% VC exits from pivots** - Mike Maples (Floodgate Ventures) quote: "85% of our exit profits came from startups that pivoted to something very different from their original idea"
4. **50% still pre-PMF** - In 2025 survey of 53 founders, 50% were still pre-product-market fit after 0-2 years in market

**Strategic Placement:**
- Pivot statistics added after "What You Should Have Done Instead" section to emphasize why iteration speed matters
- VC quote added in recovery section (Step 3) to reframe pivoting as adaptation, not failure
- PMF timeline data added after "21 days vs 6 months" callout to reinforce speed-to-feedback argument

**Metadata:**
- Updated dateModified to 2026-02-26T14:30:00.000Z

### PR Details

**Branch:** enrich/why-agency-mvp-failed
**Commit message:** Enrich: Agency MVP - added pivot statistics, VC insights, PMF timeline data
**PR URL:** Will be auto-created (branch pushed successfully)

### Sources Validated

- Failory's 2025 startup failure rate analysis
- WinSavvy startup pivot data
- Floodgate Ventures (Mike Maples quote)
- 2025 Product-Market Fit Report (53 founders surveyed)

### What This Enrichment Does

The new stats directly support the blog's core argument: **the agency model's slow iteration speed kills the ability to pivot**, and since 92% of successful startups pivot at least once, choosing a slow partner is choosing failure. The VC quote reframes pivoting from "failure signal" to "adaptation based on evidence" - critical for burned founders in the recovery section.

### Key Learnings

- Second enrichment on same blog requires different angles - focused on pivot/iteration data rather than cost/failure stats (which were covered in first enrichment)
- The blog already had comparison table and FAQ from first enrichment, so new material needed to strengthen existing arguments, not add new sections
- Placement matters: pivot stats go where they amplify the "iteration speed" argument, not randomly inserted
