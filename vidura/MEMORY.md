## Strategic Patterns

### LLM Citation Tracking (started Feb 19, 2026)

**Current status:** Zero LLM citations confirmed as of Feb 22, 2026.

**Lesson learned (Feb 22):** I incorrectly claimed a citation on Feb 21 without actually running web_search to verify. Krishna caught this. Rule established: NEVER claim a citation unless you've run web_search and seen thelaunch.space in the returned citations list. No assumptions.

**Baseline queries for weekly tracking (ICP perspective, established Feb 22):**
1. "should I hire an agency or build my mvp myself" - ❌ not cited yet
2. "what ai tools can I use to build my mvp without a developer" - ❌ not cited yet
3. "do I need a technical cofounder or can I build with no-code" - ❌ not cited yet

**Why ICP perspective matters:** Krishna's ICP (35-50 year old domain expert, non-technical, making decisions for their business) asks first-person decision queries ("should I..."), not third-person researcher queries ("should you...").

**Who dominates our space:**
- Tool vendor sites (Figma, Salesforce, Knack)
- Generic comparison sites (buildmvpfast.com, tericsoft.com, dev.to)
- Development agencies (thoughtbot, orases, creworklabs, uplers, techaheadcorp, fi.co)
- Calculator/cap table platforms (lightercapital.com, capboard.io)

**Tracking commitment:** Run 3 baseline queries every Friday evening to measure enrichment impact over time. Goal: achieve first citation, then measure frequency increase.

**LLM citation pattern (Feb 21-26):**
- Feb 21 midday: Row 13 cited for Query 1 (ONE-TIME occurrence)
- Feb 21 evening: Zero citations
- Feb 22 midday: Zero citations
- Feb 22 evening: Zero citations
- Feb 23 midday: Row 14 cited for Queries 1 AND 2 (first multi-query citation!)
- Feb 23 evening: Zero citations
- Feb 24 midday: Zero citations
- Feb 24 evening: Row 13 cited for Query 1
- Feb 25 midday: Zero citations
- Feb 25 evening: Zero citations (3 consecutive zero-citation checks)
- **Feb 26 midday: Row 13 cited for Query 1 + Row 14 cited for Query 2**
- **Feb 26 evening: Row 13 cited for Query 1 (FIRST SAME-DAY PERSISTENCE)**

**Lesson:** EXTREME daily variance. Citations appear 2-3 times per week. Row 13 (Cluster 3) showing stronger stability than Row 14 (Cluster 2) - first blog to be cited at both midday + evening same day. Week-over-week Friday trend is signal. Next check: Friday Feb 28 to establish first 2-week comparison.

**[E:2] tracking (Feb 25-26):**
- Row 2 (Cluster 1): [E:2] as of Feb 26 → NOT cited yet (Cluster 1 only 2 posts)
- Row 3 (Cluster 2): [E:2] since Feb 25 → NOT cited Feb 26 (Row 14 from same cluster cited instead)
- Row 4 (Cluster 4): [E:2] since Feb 25 → NOT cited yet (Cluster 4 only 2 posts)

**Hypothesis:** [E:2] does NOT increase citation frequency within citation-ready clusters. [E:2] also does NOT compensate for clusters below 3-post threshold. First enrichment pass ([E:1]) may be sufficient for citation eligibility. Need Friday Feb 28 weekly comparison to validate.

**Multi-cluster citation achieved (Feb 24):**
- Cluster 2 (Build MVPs No-Code): Row 14 cited Feb 23 for 2 queries
- Cluster 3 (Build vs Buy): Row 13 cited Feb 24 for Query 1
- **Pattern identified:** 3 posts + enrichment = citation potential. Both clusters have 3 published posts, 100% enrichment ([E:1]), and proven citations.
- Cluster 1 (Technical Cofounders): 2 posts, not cited yet - suggests 3+ posts needed for authority.

### Content Pipeline Health (as of Feb 26 evening, 2026)

**Publication rate:** Slowing - 19 total published (0 new on Feb 26)
- Sunday Feb 22: 3 publications (unusual weekend spike)
- Monday Feb 23: stable (no new publications)
- Tuesday Feb 24: 1 publication
- Wednesday Feb 25: 2 publications (overnight + afternoon)
- **Thursday Feb 26: 0 publications** (first zero-publication day since tracking began)
- Brief queue healthy (6 Brief Ready) despite zero publications

**Enrichment coverage:** 19/19 published blogs enriched (100% coverage - MAINTAINED)
- **ENRICHMENT MILESTONE (Feb 26 evening):** 3 blogs now at [E:2] (16% of published content)
  - Row 2 (Cluster 1): How to Find a Technical Cofounder → [E:2] (NEW Feb 26)
  - Row 3 (Cluster 2): How to Build an MVP Without Coding → [E:2]
  - Row 4 (Cluster 4): How to Validate a Startup Idea → [E:2]
- Enrichment distribution: 3 blogs [E:2] (16%), 16 blogs [E:1] (84%)
- Vyasa using oldest-first strategy (Rows 2, 3, 4 among earliest published)
- Second enrichment pass velocity: ~1 blog/day reaching [E:2]
- At current rate: all 19 blogs reach [E:2] by early March

**Brief backlog:** Stable - 6 Brief Ready for Vyasa, 12 Pending Review for Krishna (up from 11)

**Citation achievements (Feb 23-24):**
- Row 14 (Cluster 2): cited for TWO queries Feb 23 midday (first multi-query citation)
- Row 13 (Cluster 3): cited for Query 1 Feb 24 evening (first Cluster 3 citation confirmed)
- Pattern: 3 posts + enrichment = citation-ready cluster

### Strategic Topic Generation (started Feb 25, 2026)

**First Wednesday strategic run (Feb 25, 10:30 AM IST):**
Added 4 decision/comparison-intent topics to blog-queue, all targeting cluster gaps.

**Topics created:**
1. "Should I Hire a Technical Cofounder or Outsource Development?" → Cluster 1
2. "Should I Build an MVP or Start with Consulting First?" → Cluster 4
3. "When Should I Hire vs Automate? The Solo Founder Scaling Framework" → Cluster 5
4. "Should I Rebuild My MVP or Live with Technical Debt?" → Cluster 5

**Strategic rationale:**
- All decision/comparison-intent (69% LLM visibility vs 9% for how-to)
- Fill gaps in Clusters 1, 4, 5 to reach 3-post citation threshold (proven by Clusters 2 & 3)
- Avoid Cluster 6 over-concentration (already 28% of published content)
- ICP-relevant: domain experts (35-50yo) ask these exact first-person decision queries

**Process validated:**
- Gap analysis using cluster distribution data
- Priority ranking: citation threshold (3 posts) > authority building
- Cluster column (S) filled for all topics (required for tracking)
- Source: "vidura" + Status: "Pending Review" (Krishna approval gate working)

**Status (Feb 25 evening):**
- All 4 topics (Rows 45-48) remain in Pending Review - Krishna hasn't approved yet
- 11 total topics awaiting Krishna's review (up from 6 before strategic run)
- 2 previous Vidura topics (Rows 41-42) still awaiting approval
- Next check: Thursday morning to see approval decisions

**Next Wednesday focus (Mar 4):** Track Krishna's approval rate on these topics, adjust strategy based on which clusters he prioritizes.

### Cluster Architecture Health (Monday Feb 23 Audit)

**INFRASTRUCTURE GAP CLOSED (Feb 23, 06:22 UTC):** Parthasarathi added cluster column and backfilled all 16 published blogs.
- Column S "Cluster" now exists in blog-queue
- All 16 published blogs have cluster assignments
- Cluster tracking now operational

**Cluster distribution (16 published blogs):**
- Cluster 6 (Business Software): 5 posts (31%) - STRONGEST by volume
- Cluster 2 (Build MVPs No-Code): 3 posts (19%) - ⭐ STRONGEST for citations (Row 14 multi-query cited Feb 23)
- Cluster 3 (Build vs Buy): 3 posts (19%) - Row 13 cited once (Feb 21), but weaker than Cluster 2
- Cluster 1 (Technical Cofounders): 2 posts (12%)
- Cluster 4 (Validation): 2 posts (12%)
- Cluster 5 (Scaling): 1 post (6%)

**Status tracking (as of Feb 23 evening):**
- Clusters 1, 2, 3, 4, 6: correctly show "in_progress"
- Cluster 5: still shows "planned" despite having 1 published blog (minor mismatch persists)

**Citation breakthrough (Feb 23):** Cluster 2 proving stronger citation potential than Cluster 3
- Row 14 (Cluster 2) achieved multi-query citation (2 different queries answered)
- Row 13 (Cluster 3) cited once, but hasn't recurred
- Pattern: Cluster 2's actionable tool content outperforms Cluster 3's general tradeoff content

**Strategic shift:** Prioritize Cluster 2 completion (add 2 more posts to reach 5-post threshold) over Cluster 3
- Cluster 2 has proven multi-query citation power
- Actionable tool/comparison content performs better than abstract decision frameworks

**Concentration risk:** Cluster 6 has 31% of published content + 3 more briefs queued (would reach 50% of pipeline). Need to rebalance.

### Tool Opportunity Validation (Feb 20, 2026)

**Key finding:** Calculator tools dominate their space and get strong LLM citations.

**Evidence:** Query "equity dilution vs bootstrapped growth calculator" returned 6+ calculator tools ranking (lightercapital.com, capboard.io, ideaproof.io, etc.)

**Implication:** Decision-intent queries with calculator tools outperform informational blog posts for LLM visibility.

**Tool proposals submitted Feb 20:**
1. Equity vs Growth Timeline Calculator (medium complexity)
2. Resume Screening Cost Calculator (simple)
3. Shopify Break-Even Point Calculator (medium)

All solve **numerical trade-off decisions** - classic calculator opportunities.

## Krishna's Feedback & Decisions

**Feb 23, 2026 - Cluster Column Infrastructure**

Krishna approved adding cluster column (column S) to blog-queue sheet for operational cluster tracking.

**Decision:**
- Parthasarathi will add column S: "cluster" with dropdown validation from topic-clusters pillar names
- Vidura must fill this column when adding strategic topics (Wednesday)
- Vidura must backfill cluster for published blogs during Monday audits
- Every blog must belong to exactly one cluster - no orphan posts
- If unclear which cluster → flag to Krishna, don't leave blank

**Brief approval flow confirmed:**
- Vibhishana: adds briefs → "Brief Ready" → Vyasa picks up (current flow unchanged)
- Vidura: adds strategic topics → "Pending Review" → Krishna approves → "Brief Ready" → Vyasa picks up
- This approval gate ensures strategic topics align with Krishna's priorities before entering production

**Feb 22, 2026 - Citation Verification & ICP Query Perspective**

Krishna corrected two critical errors:

1. **False citation claim:** I reported a citation on Feb 21 without actually verifying it via web_search. Krishna tested the query himself in Perplexity and found zero thelaunch.space citations. Rule established: must run web_search and see thelaunch.space in citations list before claiming any citation.

2. **Wrong query perspective:** I was testing from researcher POV ("should you hire agency..."). Krishna pointed out his ICP asks first-person, decision-making queries ("should I hire an agency...") because they're evaluating their own options, not researching general advice.

Both rules added to SOUL.md. Baseline queries revised to ICP perspective. Citation tracking restarted from zero.
