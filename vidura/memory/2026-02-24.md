- Pattern: Cluster 2 (Build MVPs No-Code) proving stronger citation potential than Cluster 3 (Build vs Buy)
- Next scheduled LLM check: Friday Feb 28 (weekly tracking to measure enrichment impact)

### Today's Focus
- **Tuesday = routine monitoring day** (no strategic focus scheduled)
- Morning: sheet check ✅

## 2:30 PM IST (9:00 AM UTC) - Midday Strategy

### Pipeline Status (vs morning)
- **Total briefs:** 43 (unchanged)
- **Published:** 17 (up 1 from yesterday's 16)
- **Brief Ready:** 7 (down from 8 yesterday)
- **Pending Review:** 6 (unchanged)
- **Dropped:** 8

### New Publication
- 1 blog published since yesterday (moved from Brief Ready → Published)
- Enrichment coverage still 100% (all published blogs showing [E:1])

### New Briefs Review
- Row 41 (vidura): "Should I Hire a Developer or Use No-Code Tools?" - Pending Review, awaiting Krishna approval
- Row 42 (vidura): "Custom Software vs Off-the-Shelf: Which Should I Choose?" - Pending Review, awaiting Krishna approval
- Row 44 (Vibhishana): "You Launched Your MVP. Now No One Is Using It." - Pending Review

**Cluster alignment:** All three need cluster column filled once approved by Krishna.

### LLM Citation Spot-Checks

**All 3 baseline queries tested at 9:00 AM UTC (2:30 PM IST):**

**Query 1:** "should I hire an agency or build my mvp myself"
- Result: ❌ NOT CITED
- Who appeared: thoughtbot.com, orases.com, creworklabs.com, geeksglobalworld.com, zendev.se, designrevision.com

**Query 2:** "what ai tools can I use to build my mvp without a developer"
- Result: ❌ NOT CITED
- Who appeared: techpoint.org, youtube.com, beyondlabs.io, dev.to, raw.studio

**Query 3:** "do I need a technical cofounder or can I build with no-code"
- Result: ❌ NOT CITED
- Who appeared: nextbigthing.ag, foundersnetwork.com, airdev.co, coffeespace.com, every.to, ycombinator.com

### Key Insight

**Daily variance confirmed:** Zero citations today, consistent with Monday evening (which also had zero despite 2 citations at Monday midday).

Pattern: Same content goes from cited → not cited within hours. Weekly Friday checks remain the correct approach for measuring trends. Next check: Friday Feb 28.

- Result: ✅ **CITED!**

### Strategic Insights

**1. CLUSTER 3 BREAKTHROUGH - Row 13 Cited!**
- First time Row 13 (Cluster 3: Build vs Buy) has been cited in our tracking
- Appeared for Query 1 - the exact query it was designed to answer
- Validates Monday's cluster audit recommendation: Cluster 3 is citation-ready

**2. Daily variance pattern holds:**
- Yesterday midday: Row 14 (Cluster 2) cited for 2 queries, Row 13 NOT cited
- Yesterday evening: ZERO citations
- Today midday: ZERO citations
- Today evening: Row 13 (Cluster 3) cited, Row 14 NOT cited
- **Lesson:** Different blogs from different clusters rotate through citation rankings daily. Weekly tracking remains correct.

**3. Cluster 2 vs Cluster 3 comparison:**
- Cluster 2 (Build MVPs No-Code): Row 14 cited yesterday for multi-query
- Cluster 3 (Build vs Buy): Row 13 cited today for its target query
- Both clusters (3 posts each) proving citation potential
- Both have 100% enrichment ([E:1] on all posts)

**4. Multi-cluster citation pattern emerging:**
- We now have citations from TWO different clusters (2 and 3)
- Both clusters have 3 published posts + full enrichment
- Suggests 3-post + enrichment threshold is working for LLM visibility

**5. Cluster 1 still not cited:**
- Query 3 (technical cofounder) targets Cluster 1
- Cluster 1 has only 2 published posts (vs 3 for Clusters 2 and 3)
- Possible evidence that 3+ posts needed for consistent citation power

### Enrichment Strategy Evaluation

**Current state:**
- 100% enrichment coverage (all 17 published blogs at [E:1])
- First enrichment pass completed for entire published library
- Both cited blogs (Row 13, Row 14) have enrichment

**Evidence of enrichment impact:**
- Too early to definitively measure (only 5 days since enrichment began)
- Both citations come from enriched content (correlation, not causation yet)
- Need Friday Feb 28 data for week-over-week comparison

**Next steps:**
- Continue weekly Friday citation tracking
- Monitor whether second enrichment pass ([E:2]) increases citation frequency
- Compare clusters with similar post counts (2 vs 3) for citation differences

### Cluster Health Summary

| Cluster | Posts | Enriched | Citation Status | Assessment |
|---------|-------|----------|-----------------|------------|
| Cluster 6 (Business Software) | 5 | 5/5 [E:1] | Not tested | OVER-CONCENTRATED |
| Cluster 2 (Build MVPs No-Code) | 3 | 3/3 [E:1] | ✅ Row 14 cited Feb 23 | CITATION-READY |
| Cluster 3 (Build vs Buy) | 3 | 3/3 [E:1] | ✅ Row 13 cited Feb 24 | CITATION-READY |
| Cluster 1 (Technical Cofounders) | 2 | 2/2 [E:1] | ❌ Not cited | NEEDS 1 MORE POST |
| Cluster 4 (Validation) | 2 | 2/2 [E:1] | Not tested | NEEDS 1 MORE POST |
| Cluster 5 (Scaling) | 1 | 1/1 [E:1] | Not tested | BARELY STARTED |

**Pattern identified:** 3+ posts + enrichment = citation potential. 2 posts = not enough authority yet.

### Recommendations

1. **Validate 3-post threshold:** Add 1 more post to Cluster 1 (Technical Cofounders) to test if it achieves citation parity with Clusters 2 and 3. Monitor Query 3 results after publication.

2. **Rebalance away from Cluster 6:** 5 posts (29% of published content) + 3 more briefs queued risks over-concentration. Redirect new topics to under-invested clusters (1, 4, 5).

3. **Monitor citation rotation:** Track which blog gets cited each Friday. If Row 13 and Row 14 continue alternating, suggests both clusters equally strong. If one dominates, adjust strategy.

4. **Week-over-week comparison (Friday Feb 28):** Compare Friday Feb 21 vs Friday Feb 28 citation results. This will be first clean week-over-week measurement of enrichment impact.

5. **Second enrichment pass:** Watch for Vyasa's second enrichment pass ([E:2]). Compare citation frequency before/after to measure incremental impact.
