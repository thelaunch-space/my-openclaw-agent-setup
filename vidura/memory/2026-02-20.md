## 10:30 AM IST (5:00 AM UTC) - Friday Tool Opportunity Scan

### Reddit Scan Analysis
Reviewed last 50 questions from Vibhishana's scans (rows 723-772).

**Tool candidates identified:** 3 high-value opportunities

### New Tool Proposals Added to Sheet

**1. Equity vs Growth Timeline Calculator** (Row 10)
- **Source:** Row 753 - "How do you decide between slow growth vs. giving up equity?" (r/smallbusiness)
- **Why tool:** Founders face this decision constantly but can't visualize the long-term trade-off. They need to see actual numbers for their situation.
- **What it does:** Compare ownership value at exit under bootstrapped vs funded scenarios. Inputs: current revenue, growth rates, equity %, exit value, timeline. Outputs: side-by-side comparison, break-even timeline.
- **Target keyword:** "equity dilution vs growth calculator"
- **Complexity:** Medium
- **Status:** Proposed

**2. Resume Screening Cost Calculator** (Row 11)
- **Source:** Row 727 - "How do agencies handle screening 200+ resumes per role?" (r/Entrepreneur)
- **Why tool:** Agencies/hiring managers can't quantify screening cost to justify automation or outsourcing.
- **What it does:** Calculate total annual screening cost and break-even for ATS/outsourcing. Inputs: applications per role, minutes per resume, hourly rate, roles per year. Outputs: total cost, hours spent, cost per hire, break-even point.
- **Target keyword:** "resume screening cost calculator"
- **Complexity:** Simple
- **Status:** Proposed

**3. Shopify Break-Even Point Calculator** (Row 12)
- **Source:** Row 739 - "At what point does Shopify stop making financial sense?" (r/Entrepreneur)
- **Why tool:** E-commerce founders hit revenue threshold where Shopify transaction fees (2.9% + 30¢) become painful. They need to see their exact break-even for migration.
- **What it does:** Calculate current Shopify cost, project costs at different revenue levels, show break-even for migrating to WooCommerce/custom. Inputs: monthly revenue, AOV, orders/month, current plan. Outputs: current cost breakdown, projections, migration break-even.
- **Target keyword:** "shopify cost calculator break even"
- **Complexity:** Medium
- **Status:** Proposed

### Pattern Observed
All 3 tools solve **decision-making problems with numerical trade-offs**:
- Equity vs growth: dilution vs ownership value
- Resume screening: DIY cost vs automation ROI
- Shopify migration: ongoing fees vs migration cost

These are classic "calculator" opportunities where founders need to see their own numbers to make confident decisions.

### Other Candidates Considered (Not Added)
- Conversion rate ROI estimator (Row 735) - too generic, overlaps with existing marketing calculators
- QuickBooks alternatives comparison (Row 756) - software comparison, not calculator-style tool

### Next Steps
- Posted proposals to #vidura-seo-strategy for Krishna's review
- All 3 marked as "proposed" status - Krishna decides whether to approve or reject
- These are client-side calculator tools - no backend, no API keys needed

## 7:30 PM IST (2:00 PM UTC) - Evening Review

### Pipeline Status Changes (vs yesterday)

**Content growth:**
- Total briefs: 37 (up from 36)
- Published blogs: 13 (up from 11) - 2 new publications today
- Enriched blogs: 4 (up from 1) - 3 more enriched today (rows 3, 4, 7, 8 all showing [E:1])

**Queue status:**
- Brief Ready: 11 (same as yesterday) - Vyasa has healthy backlog
- Pending Review: 1 (down from 12!) - Krishna cleared backlog
- Needs Revision: 4 (up from 3)
- Dropped: 7 (up from 4)
- PR Created: 1

**Cluster health:**
- Still 6 clusters total (3 in_progress, 3 planned)
- No new clusters added today
- Most clusters still early-stage with limited published content

### LLM Citation Spot-Check (3 queries tested)

**Query 1:** "best ai tools for non-technical founders to build mvp"
- Result: ❌ NOT CITED
- Who appeared: buildmvpfast.com, tericsoft.com, dev.to, Figma, Synthesia, Builder.io, nocode.mba
- Pattern: Generic tool comparison sites + official vendor sites

**Query 2:** "should you hire developers or use no-code tools"
- Result: ❌ NOT CITED
- Who appeared: uplers.com, animaapp.com, Knack, Salesforce, techaheadcorp.com, acquia.com, twinr.dev
- Pattern: Development agencies + SaaS vendors + tech blogs

**Query 3:** "equity dilution vs bootstrapped growth calculator"
- Result: ❌ NOT CITED
- Who appeared: alexanderjarvis.com, terms.law, lightercapital.com, runfutureproof.com, capboard.io, ideaproof.io
- Pattern: Calculator tools, cap table platforms, legal/finance tech sites

### Key Observations

1. **Enrichment acceleration** - 3 more blogs enriched today (300% increase from yesterday). This is Vyasa's enrichment cycle kicking in. Good momentum.

2. **Publication rate steady** - 2 new blogs published today shows healthy output. Krishna clearing Pending Review backlog (12 -> 1) means pipeline flow is working.

3. **Zero LLM visibility persists** - Same as yesterday: thelaunch.space still doesn't appear in AI search responses for any target queries. Not surprising since enrichment just started.

4. **Calculator opportunity validated** - Query 3 shows 6+ calculator tools ranking for equity dilution topic. The tool I proposed this morning (Equity vs Growth Calculator) directly targets this space.

### Strategic Insights

**Why we're still not getting cited:**
- Content too fresh (most published recently)
- Enrichment just started (only 4 blogs enriched, most with 1 pass)
- Need 2-3 weeks of consistent enrichment to see impact
- Missing authority signals (FAQ sections, stats, structured data)

**Enrichment strategy effectiveness:**
- **Can't evaluate impact yet** - 4 enriched blogs is too small a sample
- **Process is accelerating** - 3x increase in enrichment today shows Vyasa's automation working
- **Need tracking baseline** - Should run same 3 queries weekly to measure progress

**Tool opportunity timing:**
- Calculator tools dominate their space (Query 3 showed 6+ ranking)
- This validates today's tool proposals - calculators get LLM citations
- Decision-intent queries (comparison/calculator) outperform informational queries for LLM visibility

### Recommendations

1. **Maintain enrichment momentum** - 9 more published blogs need enrichment. At current pace (3/day), all blogs will have first pass in 3 days. Good trajectory.

2. **Establish LLM citation tracking baseline** - Run these same 3 queries every Friday evening to build trend data. Zero citations today is fine - what matters is the trend over 4-6 weeks.

3. **Prioritize calculator tool builds** - Query 3 validation shows calculator tools get strong LLM visibility. The 3 tools I proposed today (equity, resume screening, Shopify) should be high priority if Krishna approves.

4. **Add FAQ sections during enrichment** - Competitor content consistently has robust FAQ sections. This should be part of Vyasa's enrichment checklist.

### Next Week Focus

- **Monday (Feb 23):** Full cluster audit - completeness, gaps, prioritization
- **Wednesday (Feb 25):** Strategic topic generation based on cluster gaps
- **Friday (Feb 27):** Tool opportunity scan + weekly LLM citation trend check
