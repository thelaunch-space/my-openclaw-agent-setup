### Reddit Scan Analysis
Reviewed last 50 questions from Vibhishana's scans (rows 723-772).

**Tool candidates identified:** 3 high-value opportunities

### New Tool Proposals Added to Sheet

**1. Equity vs Growth Timeline Calculator** (Row 10)
- **Source:** Row 753 - "How do you decide between slow growth vs. giving up equity?" (r/smallbusiness)
- **Why tool:** Founders face this decision constantly but can't visualize the long-term trade-off. They need to see actual numbers for their situation.
- **What it does:** Compare ownership value at exit under bootstrapped vs funded scenarios. Inputs: current revenue, growth rates, equity %, exit value, timeline. Outputs: side-by-side comparison, break-even timeline.
- **Target keyword:** "equity dilution vs growth calculator"
- **Complexity:** Medium
- **Status:** Proposed

**2. Resume Screening Cost Calculator** (Row 11)
- **Source:** Row 727 - "How do agencies handle screening 200+ resumes per role?" (r/Entrepreneur)
- **Why tool:** Agencies/hiring managers can't quantify screening cost to justify automation or outsourcing.
- **What it does:** Calculate total annual screening cost and break-even for ATS/outsourcing. Inputs: applications per role, minutes per resume, hourly rate, roles per year. Outputs: total cost, hours spent, cost per hire, break-even point.
- **Target keyword:** "resume screening cost calculator"
- **Complexity:** Simple
- **Status:** Proposed

**3. Shopify Break-Even Point Calculator** (Row 12)
- **Source:** Row 739 - "At what point does Shopify stop making financial sense?" (r/Entrepreneur)
- **Why tool:** E-commerce founders hit revenue threshold where Shopify transaction fees (2.9% + 30¢) become painful. They need to see their exact break-even for migration.
- **What it does:** Calculate current Shopify cost, project costs at different revenue levels, show break-even for migrating to WooCommerce/custom. Inputs: monthly revenue, AOV, orders/month, current plan. Outputs: current cost breakdown, projections, migration break-even.
- **Target keyword:** "shopify cost calculator break even"
- **Complexity:** Medium
- **Status:** Proposed

### Pattern Observed
All 3 tools solve **decision-making problems with numerical trade-offs**:
- Equity vs growth: dilution vs ownership value
- Resume screening: DIY cost vs automation ROI
- Shopify migration: ongoing fees vs migration cost

These are classic "calculator" opportunities where founders need to see their own numbers to make confident decisions.

### Other Candidates Considered (Not Added)
- Conversion rate ROI estimator (Row 735) - too generic, overlaps with existing marketing calculators
- QuickBooks alternatives comparison (Row 756) - software comparison, not calculator-style tool

### Next Steps
- Posted proposals to #vidura-seo-strategy for Krishna's review
- All 3 marked as "proposed" status - Krishna decides whether to approve or reject
- These are client-side calculator tools - no backend, no API keys needed
