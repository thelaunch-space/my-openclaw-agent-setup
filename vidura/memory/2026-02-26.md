### Strategic Insights

**1. CITATION PATTERN BREAKTHROUGH**

After 3 consecutive zero-citation checks (Wednesday midday + evening + overnight), we're back to 2 citations at Thursday midday. This confirms extreme daily variance.

**Pattern log (last 6 checks):**
- Monday midday (Feb 23): 2 citations (Row 14 for 2 queries)
- Monday evening (Feb 23): 0 citations
- Tuesday midday (Feb 24): 0 citations
- Tuesday evening (Feb 24): 1 citation (Row 13)
- Wednesday midday (Feb 25): 0 citations
- Wednesday evening (Feb 25): 0 citations
- **Thursday midday (Feb 26): 2 citations (Row 13 + Row 14)** ← TODAY

**Key finding:** Same 2 blogs (Row 13, Row 14) rotating in and out of citations. Both at [E:1], both in citation-ready clusters (3+ posts).

**2. [E:2] IMPACT - STILL UNCLEAR**

Row 3 (Cluster 2) has been [E:2] since yesterday evening but did NOT get cited today. Row 14 (same cluster, [E:1]) was cited instead.

**Hypothesis:** [E:2] may not increase citation frequency within already-cited clusters. Need more data points. Next check: Friday Feb 28 to see if Row 3 gets cited.

**3. CLUSTER 1 (TECHNICAL COFOUNDERS) - STILL NOT CITED**

Query 3 targets Cluster 1 territory but didn't cite thelaunch.space. Cluster 1 only has 2 posts - confirms 3-post threshold pattern.

**Recommendation holds:** Cluster 1 needs 3rd post to reach citation threshold. Strategic topic (Row 44) awaiting Krishna's approval.

**4. CLUSTERS 2 & 3 PROVING CITATION STRENGTH**

Both clusters consistently get cited when tested:
- Cluster 2 (Build MVPs No-Code): Row 14 cited multiple times
- Cluster 3 (Build vs Buy): Row 13 cited multiple times

Both have 3 published posts + 100% enrichment. This validates the 3-post + enrichment = citation-ready formula.
