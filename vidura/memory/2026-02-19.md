# 2026-02-19 (Thursday)

## 9:00 AM UTC (2:30 PM IST) - First Midday Strategy Run

**Status:** Fresh workspace initialization

- Midday strategy cron job fired for the first time
- No briefs exist yet in workspace
- No memory files or cluster documents found
- BOOTSTRAP.md still present (workspace not initialized)
- IDENTITY.md and USER.md are blank templates

**Action needed:**
- Workspace needs initialization with SEO brief structure
- Need to establish where briefs are stored/created
- Need to define cluster alignment process
- Need baseline for LLM citation checks

**Note:** Cron job configured for 2:30 PM IST daily midday strategy reviews.

## 2:00 PM UTC (7:30 PM IST) - Evening Review

### Pipeline Status
- **Total briefs:** 36 in blog-queue
- **Published:** 11 blogs (1 enriched)
- **Brief Ready:** 5 waiting for Vyasa
- **Pending Review:** 12 awaiting Krishna's approval
- **Needs Revision:** 3
- **PR Created:** 1
- **Dropped:** 4

### Cluster Health
- **Total clusters:** 6 defined
- **In progress:** 3 (Finding Technical Cofounders, Building MVPs Without Code, Build vs Buy)
- **Planned:** 3 (Validation to First 100 Customers, Scaling Without Breaking, Choosing Business Software)
- **Gap analysis:** Only 1 published blog has been enriched. Most clusters are in early stages with limited published content.

### LLM Citation Spot-Check (3 queries tested)

**Query 1:** "how to find a technical cofounder as a non-technical founder"
- Result: ❌ NOT CITED
- Who appeared: FoundersNetwork, Y Combinator, Karl L Hughes, OnStartups
- Pattern: YC and established founder communities dominate

**Query 2:** "best AI tools for non-technical founders to build mvp"
- Result: ❌ NOT CITED
- Who appeared: Lovable, Bubble, Bolt.new, FlutterFlow, Framer (tool vendor sites + comparison sites)
- Pattern: Tool vendors + generic listicles win this space

**Query 3:** "should you hire an agency or build in-house"
- Result: ❌ NOT CITED
- Who appeared: Oomp Inc, Clear Digital, DMC, Indeed, SimpleTiger, PR Daily
- Pattern: Marketing agencies + career sites dominate

### Strategic Observations

1. **Zero LLM visibility today** - thelaunch.space did not appear in any AI search responses for 3 core target queries
2. **Authority gap** - YC, established founder communities, and big-name sites dominate informational queries
3. **Enrichment lag** - Only 1/11 published blogs has been enriched; rest are untouched
4. **Cluster maturity** - All 6 clusters are still early-stage (in_progress or planned); no cluster is "complete"
5. **Brief backlog** - 12 pending Krishna's review, 5 ready for Vyasa - healthy pipeline flow

### Insights

- **Why we're not getting cited:** Our content is too new (most published recently), lacks authority signals, and isn't enriched yet. 93% of Perplexity citations go to content 1-2 years old with updates.
- **Enrichment strategy effectiveness:** Can't evaluate yet - only 1 blog enriched. Need at least 2-3 weeks of Vyasa's enrichment cycle to see patterns.
- **Cluster approach working:** Blog queue shows good cluster alignment - most briefs explicitly reference which cluster they belong to.

### Recommendations

1. **Prioritize enrichment on published content** - 10 of 11 published blogs need their first enrichment pass. This is the fastest path to LLM visibility.
2. **Complete the "Build vs Buy" cluster first** - It has the most published content (3+ blogs) and targets decision-intent queries with high LLM visibility potential.
3. **Track citation trends weekly** - Run these same 3 queries every Thursday evening to measure progress over time.
4. **Add FAQ sections to enrichment checklist** - Noticed competitor content has robust FAQ sections; we should systematically add these during enrichment.
