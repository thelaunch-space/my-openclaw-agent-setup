## 7:30 PM IST (2:00 PM UTC) - Evening Review

### Pipeline Status (vs midday)
- **Total briefs:** 38 (unchanged)
- **Published:** 13 (unchanged)
- **Enriched:** 7 of 13 (54%) - UP from 5 at midday
  - Rows 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11 all showing [E:1]
  - 2 more blogs enriched this afternoon (rows 10, 11)
  - 6 blogs remaining for first enrichment pass
- **Brief Ready:** 10 (unchanged)
- **Pending Review:** 2 (unchanged)
- **Clusters:** 6 total (3 in_progress, 3 planned) - unchanged

### Enrichment Acceleration Pattern
**Progress tracking:**
- Feb 19: 1 blog enriched (8% of published)
- Feb 20: 4 blogs enriched (31% of published)
- Feb 21 midday: 5 blogs enriched (38% of published)
- Feb 21 evening: 7 blogs enriched (54% of published)

**Vyasa's enrichment cycle is accelerating:**
- 2 enrichments today (rows 10, 11)
- At this pace, all 13 published blogs will have first enrichment pass by Tuesday Feb 24

### LLM Citation Check - Evening
**Query tested:** "when should you use no code tools vs hire developers"
- Result: ❌ NOT CITED
- Who appeared: uplers.com, fi.co, builtin.com, knack.com, animaapp.com
- Expected - afternoon enrichments need time to propagate through search indexes

### Strategic Insights

**1. First LLM citation milestone validates baseline quality**
- Midday check found row 13 blog cited WITHOUT enrichment
- This proves Krishna's baseline content quality is solid enough to get LLM citations organically
- Implication: Enrichment should ACCELERATE citation frequency, not enable it
- Expectation: As enrichment spreads across all 13 blogs, citation frequency should increase

**2. Enrichment strategy evaluation - too early, but signals positive**
- Can't measure enrichment effectiveness yet (first citations just started today)
- But: 54% enrichment coverage in 2 days shows strong momentum
- Need 2-3 weeks of weekly Friday checks to establish citation trend
- Tracking commitment: repeat 3 baseline queries every Friday

**3. Weekend pace normal**
- No new publications today (expected for Saturday)
- No new briefs since midday
- Pipeline flowing healthily into next week

### Recommendations

1. **Maintain enrichment momentum** - 6 more blogs need first pass; at current pace (2-3/day), complete by Tuesday
2. **Celebrate the milestone** - First LLM citation proves content quality works; enrichment will amplify this
3. **Monday cluster audit critical** - Need to identify which clusters have citation potential vs which need more supporting posts
4. **Tool proposals await review** - 3 calculator tools proposed Friday (equity, resume screening, Shopify) target high-LLM-visibility decision-intent queries

### Evening Report Posted
Posted to #vidura-seo-strategy at 7:30 PM IST.

Key messages:
- First LLM citation milestone achieved (row 13, non-enriched)
- Enrichment acceleration continues (54% coverage)
- Too early to measure enrichment effectiveness, but signals positive
- Monday cluster audit will identify gaps and prioritization

## 2:30 PM IST (9:00 AM UTC) - Midday Strategy

### LLM Citation Spot-Checks (3 queries tested)

**Query 1:** "how to find a technical cofounder as a non-technical founder"
- Result: ❌ NOT CITED
- Who appeared: YC Hacker News, foundersnetwork.com, karllhughes.com, onstartups.com, YouTube, YC cofounder matching
- Our blog: Row 2 (enriched [E:1]) still not breaking through

**Query 2:** "should you hire agency or build mvp yourself with AI"
- Result: ✅ **FIRST LLM CITATION ACHIEVED!**
- **Blog cited:** thelaunch.space/blogs/startup-mvps/agency-vs-in-house-development
- **Sheet row:** Row 13 - "Should You Hire an Agency or Build In-House? (The Post-Funding Decision)"
- **Critical insight:** This blog is NOT enriched yet (no [E:1] tag) - citation happened organically
- Who else appeared: orases.com, thoughtbot.com, designrevision.com, creworklabs.com, zendev.se, osmos.co, thelaunch.space

**Query 3:** "resume screening cost calculator for small business hiring"
- Result: ❌ NOT CITED (we don't have this content yet)
- Who appeared: 8 calculator tools - resumescreening.ai, hragentlabs.com, screened.io, candidize.com, x0pa.com, ballparkhq.com, 50skills.com, amlyze.com
- Validates Friday's tool proposal: Resume Screening Cost Calculator (tool-opportunities row 11)

### Strategic Insights

**1. First LLM citation milestone achieved**
- Row 13 blog appeared in Perplexity results WITHOUT enrichment
- This validates Krishna's baseline content quality - fresh, authoritative content CAN get citations before enrichment
- Implication: Enrichment should ACCELERATE citation frequency, not enable it
- Expectation: More citations should appear as enrichment spreads across 13 published blogs

**2. Calculator tool opportunity validated (again)**
- Query 3 shows 8 calculator tools dominating the space
- Confirms Friday's pattern: decision-intent queries with calculator tools outperform informational blogs for LLM visibility
- The 3 tool proposals from Friday (equity calculator, resume screening calculator, Shopify break-even) target this exact opportunity

**3. Weekend pace holding steady**
- No new publications today (expected for Saturday)
- Brief queue healthy: 10 Brief Ready for Vyasa next week
- Pipeline flowing normally

### Midday Update Posted
Posted to #vidura-seo-strategy at 2:30 PM IST.

Key messages:
- First LLM citation achieved on non-enriched blog (validates content quality)
- Calculator tool validation continues (query 3 confirms Friday's findings)
- Weekend pace normal, pipeline healthy
- Tracking commitment: repeat same 3 queries next Friday to measure week-over-week progress
