## About the Client

Internal — this is Krishna's own business. An AI-first execution studio that converts founder ideas into shipped products in weeks. The business has two parallel priorities in early 2026: (1) a 30-day content challenge on LinkedIn/X to build credibility and audience, and (2) Launch Control GTM — getting 10-15 paying customers for the "Hire Your 24/7 Team" service ($99/mo).

The content challenge is the credibility layer for the GTM.

## Relationship

- **Type:** Internal
- **Scope:** Krishna owns everything. Five OpenClaw AI agents (Parthasarathi, Vibhishana, Vyasa, Vidura, Valmiki) run autonomously and produce daily output. Shakti's job is to help Krishna plan his own human tasks across this work stream — not to manage the agents.
- **Revenue target (2026):** $100-150k/year (~$8-12k/month). Current: under $2k/month. Need 4-6x growth.

## Key People

- **Krishna** — Solo founder. Owns strategy, product, sales, content approval.
- **Parthasarathi** — Agent orchestrator. Manages the agent team. Not a client contact — internal coordination only.

## Active Projects

### OpenClaw Agents (openclaw-agents)
- **Goal:** Run and continuously improve the 5-agent AI team that produces daily SEO blogs, LinkedIn content, and strategy for thelaunch.space.
- **Status:** Active and running daily. Parthasarathi orchestrates. Vibhishana scans Reddit → Vyasa writes blogs → Valmiki extracts LinkedIn posts → Vidura provides SEO strategy.
- **Krishna's tasks here:** Review and merge blog PRs, approve Valmiki's LinkedIn drafts, send direction to Parthasarathi when agent behavior needs updating.
- **Priority:** Ongoing — daily maintenance, not a project sprint

### Launch Control (launch-control)
- **Goal:** The internal Kanban + admin tool at thelaunch.space/launch-control. Used by Krishna to manage all agent output and tasks. Also the public face of OpenClaw's capabilities for GTM.
- **Status:** Active. Shakti Phase 0+1 just completed — Convex schema, HTTP endpoints, WorkspacePanel, task Kanban all live.
- **Krishna's tasks here:** Feature development (Claude Code), product decisions, GTM strategy.
- **Priority:** High — ongoing development as the central operating system for all work streams

### Social Media & GTM (social-gtm)
- **Goal:** 30-day LinkedIn/X content challenge + Launch Control outbound sales. Daily posts build credibility; outbound DMs and community outreach convert leads.
- **Status:** Active daily. Valmiki produces LinkedIn drafts nightly. Krishna posts manually each morning.
- **GTM strategy:** 30-day LinkedIn content challenge + outbound DM strategy to convert leads from Launch Control demo page.
- **Krishna's tasks here:** Review and post daily content, execute outbound DM strategy, track leads.
- **Priority:** High — this is the primary revenue growth lever right now

### SEO Pipeline (seo-pipeline)
- **Goal:** Build organic search traffic to thelaunch.space via daily blog posts targeting ICP keywords.
- **Status:** Active. Vibhishana mines Reddit → Vyasa writes → Krishna merges PRs. 18+ published blogs. 3 enrichment runs/day on existing posts.
- **Krishna's tasks here:** Review SEO briefs (from Vibhishana), merge blog PRs (from Vyasa), strategic direction.
- **Priority:** Medium-high — compound growth play, daily but not urgent on any single day

---

## Upcoming / Backlog Projects

- **Free tools** — Planned lead magnets (calculators, simple AI tools) for organic traffic. Not yet scoped.
- **Workshops track** — Schools for visibility, corporate for high-ticket revenue. Concept only.
- **Sanjaya reactivation** — Lead scout agent, currently paused. Reactivate when outbound volume needs scaling.

## Priority Order (across projects)

1. **Social Media & GTM** — Daily execution. This is the fastest path to revenue.
2. **Launch Control** — Ongoing development. The platform underpins everything else.
3. **SEO Pipeline** — Daily but async. Merge PRs when ready, don't let them stack up.
4. **OpenClaw Agents** — Maintenance and improvement. Intervene when Parthasarathi flags issues.
5. **Free tools / workshops** — Future. Don't plan these until GTM shows traction.
