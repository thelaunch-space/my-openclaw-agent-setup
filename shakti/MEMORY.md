## Workspace Setup (2026-02-28)

Created with full doc structure:
- `pace-model.md` — task estimates by type and client (empty baseline, populate as data comes in)
- `clients/beacon-house.md` — 14-month retainer, education consultancy, detailed context
- `clients/edutechplus.md` — Month 2 active, highest paying, voice agent + content ingestion projects
- `clients/thelaunch-space.md` — internal work, SEO/content/agent infrastructure

**These files exist. Read them before every session.**

## Krishna's Work Context

- Three work streams: thelaunch.space (internal), Beacon House (14-month retainer), EduTechPlus (active project client)
- Typical working day: 6–8 hours available
- Primary task input: Launch Control Kanban + #shakti-ops
- Task completion pattern: mix of Kanban moves and evening DM logs
- Detailed client context in `clients/` subdirectory
