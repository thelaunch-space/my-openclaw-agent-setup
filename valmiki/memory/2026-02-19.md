## Blog Queue Status (from sheet scan)

**Published:** 11 blogs live
**PR Created:** 1 (Distribution blog)
**Brief Ready:** 11 topics waiting for Vyasa pickup
**Needs Revision:** 4 topics
**Dropped:** 6 topics

## Patterns & Data Points

1. **Distribution blog is timely** - addresses the core ICP pain (building fast with AI but struggling to get customers)
2. **Strong research pipeline** - Vibhishana has created 14+ briefs in last week, good category balance
3. **Brief backlog growing** - 11 Brief Ready topics means Vyasa has plenty to choose from
4. **Convex integration stabilizing** - Vibhishana fixed field name issues, should prevent future errors

## Milestones
- ✅ 11 blogs now live (crossed double digits!)
- ✅ 700+ Reddit questions tracked in sheet
- ✅ Distribution blog addresses THE core ICP bottleneck (Krishna's #1 constraint)

## What This Means for LinkedIn Post Angle

**The distribution blog is gold** for LinkedIn content because:
- It directly addresses what Krishna experiences (80% close rate but needs more leads)
- Contrarian angle: Most founders think it's a product problem, it's actually a distribution approach problem
- Real frameworks (42% of startups fail from "no market need" but most never actually tested market need)
- Ties to Krishna's lived experience as non-marketer who figured out distribution

**Potential angles:**
1. **Lead gen angle:** "Most founders waste time perfecting their product when they should be perfecting their distribution approach"
2. **Contrarian credibility:** "42% of startups fail from 'no market need' - but here's the uncomfortable truth..."
3. **Practitioner story:** "I used to think my product wasn't good enough. Turns out I was just showing up in the wrong places."

## Notes for Tomorrow
- Check if Vidura's evening review cron routing issue is fixed
- Consider which Brief Ready topic aligns best with this week's LinkedIn content theme
- Distribution/founder-phase topics are hot right now - capitalize on momentum
