# Daily Observations - February 20, 2026

## What Happened Today

### Vyasa (Blogs)
**Published:**
- 1 new daily blog PR created: "I Built My App With AI. Now What?" (PR #28)
  - Topic: AI deployment reality after code generation
  - Keywords: deploy AI generated code production, bolt.new deployment stuck
  - Addresses the wall non-tech founders hit after AI generates their code
  - 6 external backlinks (METR study, Supabase docs, ShipMyAI, Netlify, Encore.cloud, GitHub)
  - ~2,500 words

**Enriched:**
- 3 enrichment PRs created today (massive acceleration from yesterday!)
  - PR #29: "Why Your Agency Wasted $30K on Your MVP" (5 stats + Steve Blank quote + comparison table + FAQ)
  - PR #30: "Why You Can't Find a Technical Cofounder" (5 stats from Carta/HubSpot/Bubble + 8 FAQs)
  - PR #31: "How to Find a Technical Cofounder" (5 stats + comparison table + FAQ + 3 stat callout boxes)
  - Word count expansions: ~2,500 → ~3,800 words on cofounder post
  
**Pattern:** Enrichment momentum building! 4/13 published blogs now have first enrichment pass (300% increase from yesterday).

### Vibhishana (SEO Research)
**Morning scan:**
- 46 new ICP-relevant questions added from Reddit (12 subreddits, 600 posts checked)
- 726 total URLs tracked (no duplicates)

**Briefs created:**
- 1 brief created on Feb 19 (posted overnight): "Why Your First Sale Is Taking Forever"
  - Category: Founder-Phase
  - Gap: Pre-build sales methodology + horizontal→niche positioning
  - Named frameworks: Validation Reversal, Horizontal Death Trap, 5:1 Community Contribution Rule

**Issues:**
- Convex push failed for "invoice-automation-worth-it" brief (row 37)
- Likely field name mismatch issue

### Vidura (SEO Strategy)
**Morning briefing (10 AM IST):**
- Flagged enrichment bottleneck: 11/13 published blogs still need enrichment
- Noted healthy brief pipeline: 12 briefs ready for Vyasa
- Strategic focus: Enrichment is critical (93% of LLM citations go to recently-updated content)

**Tool opportunity scan (10:30 AM IST):**
- Identified 3 new tool proposals from Reddit questions:
  1. Equity vs Growth Timeline Calculator (medium complexity)
  2. Resume Screening Cost Calculator (simple)
  3. Shopify Break-Even Point Calculator (medium complexity)
- Pattern: All solve decision-making problems with numerical trade-offs

**Evening report (7:30 PM IST):**
- LLM citation check: Zero visibility for thelaunch.space across 3 target queries (expected - content too fresh)
- Who appeared instead: buildmvpfast.com, dev.to, uplers.com, calculator tools
- Recommendation: Maintain enrichment momentum, establish weekly tracking baseline

**Cluster health:**
- 6 clusters active (3 in_progress, 3 planned), all early-stage
- Brief backlog healthy: Krishna cleared Pending Review (12→1)

### Blog-Queue Status (from sheet)
**Published:** 13 blogs total
- 4 have first enrichment pass
- 9 still need enrichment (opportunity!)

**PR Created:** 1 (row 18 - deployment reality post)

**Brief Ready:** 11 briefs waiting for Vyasa to pick up

**Pending Review:** 1 brief (row 38 - ChatGPT MVP deployment)

**Needs Revision:** 4 briefs stuck

**Dropped:** 7 briefs total

## Milestones
- **Enrichment acceleration:** 1→4 enriched blogs in 24 hours (Vyasa's automation kicking in)
- **New blog live:** AI deployment reality post addresses post-generation wall
- **Tool pipeline started:** 3 viable tool opportunities identified from Reddit patterns

## Data Points
- Total blogs published: 13
- Total enriched: 4 (31%)
- Total briefs in pipeline: 11 ready + 1 pending review
- Reddit questions tracked: 726 URLs
- New questions today: 46

## Patterns & Insights

### What's Working
1. **Enrichment momentum:** Vyasa went from 1 enrichment to 3 in a single day
2. **Brief pipeline health:** 12 briefs cleared to "Brief Ready" by Krishna - strong flow
3. **Tool opportunity identification:** Vidura finding interactive content gaps (calculators)
4. **Reddit scanning consistency:** 46 new questions added daily

### Bottlenecks
1. **Enrichment backlog:** 9/13 published blogs still waiting for first enrichment pass
2. **Convex push issues:** Some briefs failing to push (field name mismatches?)
3. **"Needs Revision" stuck:** 4 briefs in limbo, may need Krishna's review

### Strategic Observations
**From Vidura's evening report:**
- Zero LLM citations is expected at this stage (content too fresh, enrichment just started)
- Query 3 ("equity dilution calculator") showed calculator tools dominate - validates tool proposal
- FAQ sections are missing from enrichment - should be added to Vyasa's checklist
- 2-3 weeks of consistent enrichment needed before we can measure LLM citation impact

**From team output:**
- Vyasa is hitting rhythm with enrichment (3 PRs in one day!)
- Vibhishana's Reddit scanning is consistent but brief creation slowed (1 brief vs previous days)
- Vidura's tool scan identified a clear pattern: numerical decision-making problems

## Tomorrow's Priorities (based on Vidura's recommendations)
1. Maintain enrichment momentum (9 more blogs need first pass)
2. Add FAQ sections to enrichment checklist
3. Fix Convex push issue for failed briefs
4. Keep tool proposals on radar (equity, resume screening, Shopify calculators)
5. Monitor "Needs Revision" briefs - may need Krishna intervention

## Questions for Krishna
- Should Vyasa prioritize enriching all 13 blogs before new content, or continue mixed flow?
- Are the 3 tool proposals worth building? (equity, resume screening, Shopify)
- What to do with 4 "Needs Revision" briefs?
