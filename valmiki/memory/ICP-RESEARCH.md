- Domain experts (ex-consultants, industry vets) building vertical SaaS
- Payment: $8K-50K projects + potential equity
- Examples:
  - 45yo ex-healthcare consultant, raised $300K, building clinic scheduling SaaS
  - Former real estate broker, validated lead-gen SaaS idea, needs MVP for Series A
  - Marketing agency owner building client reporting SaaS, funded but non-technical

**YOUR UNFAIR ADVANTAGE:** "I am you. Non-technical founder who's shipped 65 production products. I can get you from idea to deployed MVP in 3 weeks. No 6-month agency timelines, no giving 30% equity to a technical co-founder you met 2 weeks ago."

## INDUSTRY 10: FINANCIAL ADVISORY / WEALTH MANAGEMENT (RIAs)

**Geography Split:** 10% India / 90% International  
**ROI:** $$$$$ (VERY HIGH) | **Effort:** ⭐⭐⭐  
**Krishna's Advantage:** AdvisorIQ gives some context; regulatory learning curve but high payoff

### What They Optimize For
- Revenue per client ratio (not just AUM growth)
- Advisor productivity (10-20% gains needed to meet demand)
- Client retention and lifetime value
- Compliance without drowning in admin overhead
- Operational efficiency (cutting onboarding from 3 months to weeks)

### What Success Looks Like (Their Language)
- "Client onboarding cut from 3 months to 2 weeks"
- "Advisor productivity up 18% - serving 52% more clients without burnout"
- "Idle capital generating fees immediately (not sitting 90 days)"
- "Compliance reporting: 10 minutes vs. 2 days"
- "Revenue growth outpacing expense growth" (true scaling)

### What Threatens Their Business
- Advisor shortage (need 30K-80K new advisors by 2034)
- Client demand for holistic advice (52% of investors) but advisor bandwidth constraints
- Fee compression from robo-advisors
- 3-month onboarding killing fee revenue (idle capital)
- Compliance complexity (SEC, FINRA requirements)

### Their Problem Language
- "Idle capital during onboarding" (not revenue delay)
- "Advisor bandwidth" (not resource capacity)
- "Client handoff friction" (not process gap)
- "Swivel-chairing between systems" (not integration issues)
- "Sizing vs. scaling" (headcount growth vs. profit growth)

### What Keeps Them Up At Night
- "Client waited 3 months to get onboarded - lost $15K in fees on idle capital"
- "How do I serve 52% more clients demanding holistic advice without burning out advisors?"
- "We're growing headcount but profit margin is shrinking"
- "Advisors spend 40% of time swivel-chairing between 8 different systems"
- "SEC exam next quarter - compliance doc prep will take 100 hours"

### Where They Discuss/Complain
- **Associations:** NAPFA, FPA, CFP Board
- **Communities:** Kitces community, AdviserTech forums
- **Events:** NAPFA conferences, FPA Annual, Futureproof, SWAY, RTS, T3 Technology Conference
- **Thought leaders:** Michael Kitces, Mark Tibergien
- **Publications:** Financial Planning Magazine, Investment News

### Trust Triggers
- You understand SEC/FINRA compliance context
- You reference "idle capital during onboarding"
- You know RIA model (fee-based, not commission)
- Case study: "RIA cut onboarding from 90 to 14 days - $45K more fee revenue/year"
- Understanding of advisor productivity metrics

### Red Flags
- Not understanding RIA vs. broker-dealer model
- Confusing with insurance agents or MF distributors (India model)
- Generic CRM without financial services compliance
- Not knowing SEC custody rules, Form ADV requirements
- Enterprise pricing for 5-advisor firm

### How They Find Providers
- **Primary:** NAPFA/FPA member referrals, Kitces community
- **Secondary:** Conference exhibitors (T3, NAPFA), custodian recommendations (Schwab, Fidelity)
- **Tertiary:** Google, LinkedIn (financial advisor-specific searches)

### Decision Timeline
- **Urgent:** 2-4 weeks (if onboarding crisis)
- **Strategic:** 6-10 weeks (compliance review, advisor buy-in needed)
- **Who decides:** Principal advisor + ops lead (if 10+ person firm); solo RIA decides alone

### Geographic Breakdown

**India (10% - LIMITED):**
- Wealth managers, MF distributors (VERY different model - commission-based, SEBI regulated)
- Payment: ₹1L-8L projects
- Challenge: Different regulatory framework, lower tech adoption

**International (90% - PRIMARY TARGET):**
- US RIAs (10-50 person firms), UK wealth managers (IFAs)
- Payment: $15K-150K projects
- Pain: 3-month onboarding, advisor productivity, swivel-chairing between systems, compliance automation

**KEY LEARNING CURVE:**
- SEC regulations (Rule 206(4)-7 for outsourcing)
- FINRA requirements
- Custodian integrations (Schwab, Fidelity, TD Ameritrade)
- SOC 2 compliance for handling client data
- Form ADV, client privacy rules

**NOTE:** India financial advisory is structurally different (commission-based MF distribution vs. fee-based RIA model). Focus 90%+ on US market.

## BLENDED GEOGRAPHY MIX (ALL 10 INDUSTRIES)

| Industry | India % | International % | Weighted Contribution |
|----------|---------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Education Consulting | 30 | 70 | 3% India / 7% Intl |
| Healthcare Consulting | 20 | 80 | 2% India / 8% Intl |
| D2C Brands | 40 | 60 | 4% India / 6% Intl |
| Marketing Agencies | 30 | 70 | 3% India / 7% Intl |
| Corporate L&D | 50 | 50 | 5% India / 5% Intl |
| Management Consulting | 20 | 80 | 2% India / 8% Intl |
| Real Estate | 50 | 50 | 5% India / 5% Intl |
| Legal | 5 | 95 | 0.5% India / 9.5% Intl |
| SaaS Founders | 20 | 80 | 2% India / 8% Intl |
| Financial Advisory | 10 | 90 | 1% India / 9% Intl |

**TOTAL BLENDED MIX (assuming equal effort across all 10):**
- **India:** ~27%
- **International:** ~73%

**To hit your 40-60 target:**
- Focus MORE effort on: D2C, Corporate L&D, Real Estate, Marketing Agencies (higher India %)
- Focus LESS effort on: Legal, Financial, SaaS (very international-heavy)

OR

- Shift D2C to 50/50, Corporate L&D to 60/40, Marketing to 40/60
- This would bring blended to ~35% India / 65% International
