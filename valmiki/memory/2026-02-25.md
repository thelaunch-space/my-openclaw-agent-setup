# Daily Observations - February 25, 2026

## Team Output Summary

### Vibhishana (SEO Brief Creation)
**1 new brief created:**
- **"How to Stop Burning Money on Your Mobile App MVP (Before You Write Code)"**
  - Slug: `mvp-burning-money`
  - Primary keyword: mobile app MVP cost optimization
  - Source: Reddit r/startups (8 upvotes, 13 comments) - practitioner sharing hard-won MVP lessons
  - Unique angle: "Lean is about decision discipline, not cheap development"
  - Research stats: 40-70% cost reduction possible through strategic prioritization
  - Case study: Healthcare platform cut $120K → $55K by reducing features from 23 → 7
  - Status: Pending Review (Row 48)

**Blog Queue Status (Evening):**
- Published: 18
- Brief Ready: 5
- PR Created: 1
- Needs Revision: 4
- Pending Review: 12
- Dropped: 7

**Notable finding:** Gap identified - Most older briefs (17+) are not in Convex, only in Google Sheet. Many created before consistent Convex pushes were implemented. These need backfill.

**Questions Database:** 999 total questions tracked

**Tomorrow's Focus:**
- Morning scan + push questions to Convex
- Create 3 briefs per schedule (11 AM, 2 PM, 5 PM)
- Consider backfilling older briefs to Convex

### Vyasa (Blog Writing)
**No new blog PRs created today** (Feb 25)

**Context from Feb 24:**
- Krishna published 3 PRs on Feb 24:
  - "When to Skip Landing Page Tests and Just Talk to Customers" (new)
  - "Why Your MVP Costs Too Much" (enrichment)
  - "When to Stop Using Spreadsheets for Leads" (enrichment)

**Expected pattern:** Vyasa alternates between creation days and enrichment days. Feb 24 was likely a lighter day; expect blog creation activity to resume.

### Vidura (SEO Strategy)
**MILESTONE: [E:2] Second-Pass Enrichments Begin**

First second-pass enrichments confirmed:
- **Row 3** (Cluster 2: Build MVPs No-Code) → [E:2]
- **Row 4** (Cluster 4: Validation) → [E:2]

**Why this matters:**
- Row 3's cluster already cited (Row 14 cited Feb 23) → test if [E:2] increases citation frequency
- Row 4's cluster has 2 posts (below 3-post threshold) → test if [E:2] compensates for missing post
- Vyasa using oldest-first strategy (Rows 3, 4 among earliest published)

**Strategic Topic Generation (Wednesday task completed):**
Added 4 decision/comparison-intent topics to blog-queue (Rows 45-48):
1. "Should I Hire a Technical Cofounder or Outsource Development?" → Cluster 1
2. "Should I Build an MVP or Start with Consulting First?" → Cluster 4
3. "When Should I Hire vs Automate? The Solo Founder Scaling Framework" → Cluster 5
4. "Should I Rebuild My MVP or Live with Technical Debt?" → Cluster 5

**Rationale:** Targeting clusters below 3-post citation threshold. Decision-intent queries get 69% LLM visibility vs 9% for how-to.

**LLM Citation Check (Evening):**
- Query 1: ❌ NOT CITED (agency vs build)
- Query 2: ❌ NOT CITED (ai tools for mvp)
- Query 3: ❌ NOT CITED (technical cofounder vs no-code)

**Pattern:** 3 consecutive zero-citation checks (Tue midday, Tue evening, Wed midday, Wed evening). Citations appear 2-3x per week, not daily. Friday Feb 28 tracking remains correct strategy.

**Pipeline Status:**
- Published: 19 (up 2 today - unusual spike)
- Enrichment coverage: 100% (2 blogs at [E:2], 17 at [E:1])
- Brief Ready: 6
- Pending Review: 11 (up from 6 - includes Vidura's 4 strategic topics + other briefs)

**Cluster Health (19 published):**
- Cluster 6 (Business Software): 5 posts, all [E:1] - OVER-CONCENTRATED (28%)
- Cluster 2 (Build MVPs No-Code): 3 posts, 2x[E:1] + 1x[E:2] - ✅ CITED + [E:2] BOOST
- Cluster 3 (Build vs Buy): 3 posts, all [E:1] - ✅ CITED
- Cluster 4 (Validation): 2 posts, 1x[E:1] + 1x[E:2] - NEEDS 1 MORE POST + [E:2] BOOST
- Cluster 1 (Technical Cofounders): 2 posts, all [E:1] - NEEDS 1 MORE POST
- Cluster 5 (Scaling): 1 post, [E:1] - BARELY STARTED

**Next strategic focus:** Friday Feb 28 - week-over-week citation comparison (first clean enrichment impact measurement)

## Milestones

1. **First [E:2] enrichments deployed** - Testing whether second enrichment pass increases LLM citation frequency
2. **Vidura strategic topics added** - 4 decision-intent briefs targeting cluster gaps (Clusters 1, 4, 5)
3. **19 blogs published** - 2 new blogs went live today (rows not specified, but count increased from 17 → 19)
4. **Vibhishana brief targeting MVP cost** - Strong ICP angle on "burning money" pain point

---

## Data Points

- **Total blogs published:** 19 (up from 17 yesterday)
- **Enrichment coverage:** 100% (2 at [E:2], 17 at [E:1])
- **Questions database:** 999 questions tracked
- **Blog queue backlog:** 12 briefs in Pending Review (Krishna's approval queue growing)
- **Convex gap:** 17+ older briefs not synced to Convex (pre-dating consistent push process)

---

## Patterns

1. **Publication velocity:** 2 blogs published today (unusual spike; normal is ~1/day)
2. **Enrichment strategy progressing:** Vyasa moved to [E:2] for oldest blogs (oldest-first approach)
3. **LLM citation variance continuing:** Zero citations Wed midday & evening (consistent with daily rotation pattern)
4. **Strategic rebalancing:** Vidura targeting Clusters 1, 4, 5 to reach 3-post citation threshold
5. **Cluster 6 over-concentration risk:** 28% of content in one cluster; future briefs should avoid this cluster

## Questions for Krishna

(None today - observations only per instructions)

## Interesting Angles

**From Vibhishana's brief (Row 48):**
- **Counterintuitive truth:** "Clear flows save more money than cheap developers ever will"
- **Reframe:** "Lean is about decision discipline, not cheap development"
- **The trap:** Domain experts trying to "impress imaginary users" before validation
- **Practitioner credibility:** Krishna's 65+ projects in 21-day cycles = real ruthless prioritization experience

**From Vidura's strategic topics:**
- **Decision-intent focus:** "Should I hire/build/rebuild" questions get 69% LLM visibility
- **3-post threshold pattern:** Clusters with 3+ posts achieving citations; clusters with 2 posts not cited yet
- **[E:2] experiment:** Testing whether second enrichment compensates for cluster depth gaps

## Tomorrow's Focus

**Vibhishana:**
- Morning scan + Convex push (enforcing new procedure)
- 3 briefs scheduled (11 AM, 2 PM, 5 PM IST)

**Vyasa:**
- Expected: Resume blog creation or continue enrichment cycle

**Vidura:**
- Monitor Krishna's approval of 4 strategic topics (Rows 45-48)
- Track [E:2] impact on Rows 3 & 4
- No scheduled strategic work (Thursday is routine monitoring day)

**Valmiki (me):**
- 9 PM: Ping Krishna with observation summary + proposed LinkedIn angle
- Wait for Krishna's input/tweaks
- Draft post by 9:30 PM
