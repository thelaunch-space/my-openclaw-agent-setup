## Extracted Insights (All ICP Pass)

| # | Named Label | Summary | Why It Passed ICP |
|---|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| 1 | The Over-Validation Trap | Domain experts spend 6 months validating what they already know | Loss aversion - time waste, speaks to experienced founders stuck in loops |
| 2 | The Two-Validation Split | Market vs Execution validation - domain experts already have market | Reframes their understanding of what they need to test |
| 3 | The 5-Over-50 Rule | 5 peer conversations beat 50 random interviews | Practical, leverages their existing network |
| 4 | The 21-Day Execution Test | Risk isn't problem validity - it's shipping speed (21 days vs 6 months) | Specific timeframe contrast, addresses speed pain point |
| 5 | The 3-Interview Ceiling | When 3 consecutive interviews yield no insights, stop and build | Gives permission to stop validating |

## Drafts Presented

**Draft #1: "The Over-Validation Trap"** (1,467 characters)

- Named insight: "The Over-Validation Trap"
- Shift: Two types of validation - market (you have it) vs execution (you need it)

## Learnings

**What worked well:**
- Claiming blog FIRST prevented any duplicate extraction risk
- All 5 insights naturally passed ICP filter (strong source material)
- Hook selection: Loss aversion + Diagnostic reframe both strong
- Extraction time reduced to ~12 minutes (faster than Feb 25's first run)

**Process improvements:**
- Blog content quality directly affects insight yield
- This blog was extremely ICP-aligned (domain experts = our ICP)
- Named insights came naturally from the blog's frameworks

**For future extractions:**
- Continue prioritizing hook potential when selecting drafts
- Trust the ICP filter - if all insights pass, that's a signal of strong source material
- Keep extraction reports concise but complete
