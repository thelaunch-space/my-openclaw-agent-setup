## Vibhishana's Work Today (SEO/Question Mining)

### Morning Scan
- **60 new ICP questions found** across 12 subreddits
- High-signal posts included:
  - "I have a great app idea but totally stuck at the beginning" (r/entrepreneur)
  - "Clinician built a HIPAA-sensitive SaaS for rehab scheduling" (r/SaaS) — exact target vertical
  - "Bubble vs Glide vs Softr for vehicle inspection booking portal?" (r/nocode) — tool comparison paralysis
  - "We manually track electricity/gas/water from ~1000 invoices/month" (r/nocode) — automation pain

### Brief Created Today (11 AM)
**"Why Your 70%-Complete MVP Got Canceled (And How to Prevent It)"**
- **Source:** Reddit r/ExperiencedDevs thread about project canceled at 70% completion
- **Hook:** The vertical slicing trap — dev teams build layer-by-layer instead of end-to-end features
- **Competitive gap:** All existing content written FOR developers, not founders; no rescue playbook
- **Our angle:** Krishna's 65+ projects, never had cancellation because of weekly demos
- **Category:** Product Strategy / Post-MVP
- **Status:** Brief Ready for Vyasa
- **File:** `briefs/2026-02-24-mvp-canceled-at-70-percent.md`
- **Convex:** Pushed successfully (ID: jd7afr8knmb0dmtwq58gbs79eh81rc07)

### Technical Recovery Completed
- **Question push recovery:** 994 questions synced to Convex (218 new, 776 updated)
- Fixed the gap between Google Sheets and Convex question counts
- Updated AGENTS.md with stricter question push enforcement procedures

## Vidura's Strategic Findings (Evening Review, 7:30 PM IST)

### 🎯 CLUSTER 3 BREAKTHROUGH!

**Row 13 cited for the first time in Cluster 3 (Build vs Buy)**
- Post: "Should You Hire an Agency or Build In-House?"
- Appeared at position [3] for query: "should I hire an agency or build my mvp myself"
- This is the **first confirmed citation for Cluster 3**

### Multi-Cluster Validation Achieved
- **Cluster 2** (Build MVPs No-Code): Row 14 cited Feb 23 ✓
- **Cluster 3** (Build vs Buy): Row 13 cited Feb 24 ✓
- Both clusters have 3 posts + 100% enrichment

### 3-Post Threshold Pattern Confirmed
- Clusters with 3+ posts → citations achieved
- Clusters with 2 posts (Clusters 1, 4) → not cited yet
- **Implication:** 3 posts minimum for LLM authority

### Daily Citation Rotation Continues
- **Yesterday midday:** Row 14 cited (2 queries)
- **Yesterday evening:** Zero citations
- **Today midday:** Zero citations
- **Today evening:** Row 13 cited
- Same content rotates in/out within hours — **weekly tracking is the right cadence**

### Vidura's Strategic Recommendations
1. **Test the 3-post threshold:** Add 1 more post to Cluster 1 (Technical Cofounders) to reach 3 posts, monitor if Query 3 starts citing us
2. **Rebalance away from Cluster 6:** Currently 29% of content (5 posts) + 3 more briefs queued — redirect to under-invested clusters
3. **Week-over-week tracking:** Friday Feb 28 will be first clean Friday-to-Friday comparison
4. **Watch for [E:2]:** When Vyasa's second enrichment pass starts, track if citation frequency increases

## Key Data Points & Patterns

### Publication Velocity
- Steady ~1 blog/day pace
- All published blogs at [E:1] enrichment (100% coverage maintained)
- Krishna's quality review: "solid"

### Content Distribution (Cluster Analysis)
- **Cluster 6 (Business Software):** 5 posts (29% of content) — strongest by volume
- **Cluster 3 (Build vs Buy):** 3 posts (18%) — proven citation performance
- **Cluster 2 (Build MVPs No-Code):** 3 posts (18%) — also cited
- **Clusters 1, 4:** 2 posts each (12% each) — below citation threshold
- **Cluster 5:** 1 post (6%) — barely started

### Citation Performance Insights
- **Decision-intent content + enrichment + 3+ posts = citations**
- Tool comparisons (Cluster 2) outperform abstract frameworks (Cluster 3) for citation frequency
- Daily LLM variance is extreme — only weekly trends matter

### ICP Question Mining
- 994 total questions tracked in Google Sheets
- 60 new questions today alone
- Healthcare, no-code, automation pain points emerging as strong signals

## Notable Reddit Findings (Potential LinkedIn Angles)

1. **"70% complete" MVP cancellation story** — perfect for vertical slicing vs horizontal development angle
2. **Clinician building HIPAA SaaS** — exact ICP (domain expert hitting tech limits post-MVP)
3. **Manual invoice tracking (~1000/month)** — operations automation pain, internal tools opportunity
4. **Tool comparison paralysis** (Bubble vs Glide vs Softr) — classic non-technical founder stuck in research mode

## Content Opportunities for LinkedIn

Based on today's team findings, potential post angles:

1. **The 70% Trap** — "Your dev team says the project is 70% complete. Stakeholders see nothing to demo. Here's why it got canceled..." (vertical slicing, Friday Demo Test, practitioner credibility)

2. **Healthcare Tech Paralysis** — "Built a HIPAA-compliant SaaS. Now what? The post-build anxiety domain experts don't talk about..." (healthcare vertical, post-MVP pivot decisions)

3. **Tool Comparison Hell** — "Spent 3 weeks comparing Bubble vs Glide vs Softr. Still haven't built anything. Here's the real decision framework..." (decision paralysis, when to stop researching)

4. **The Automation Blindspot** — "Processing 1000 invoices/month manually. Tried automating. Now it's its own side project. The infra trap non-technical founders fall into..." (operations automation, when DIY breaks)

**Next steps:**
- Wait for 9 PM IST cron to post observation summary + angle proposal to Krishna
- Use this data to inform tonight's brainstorming session
