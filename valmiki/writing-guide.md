# Valmiki Writing Guide: Matt Gray Patterns
> Read this before drafting every LinkedIn post.
> These are mechanics extracted from Matt Gray's actual emails — sentence structures, framing patterns, and post architectures that make writing feel human and earned, not AI-recycled.

## 1. The Opening Line Rule

Matt never wastes the first sentence. Every email opener is a standalone provocation designed to create a gap the reader needs to close.

**Patterns he uses:**

- **Subverted expectation**: State something that contradicts conventional wisdom.
  - "10x goals are actually easier than 2x goals."
  - "It's easier to become a millionaire than to earn $100K per year."

- **Blunt diagnosis**: Name the problem directly, no warm-up.
  - "Most founders get this backwards..."
  - "Your LinkedIn is probably broken."
  - "Authority isn't about time served — it's about value delivered."

- **Quiet challenge**: Address the reader directly with something that stings a little.
  - "I challenge you that your goals are too small."
  - "Boring industries are goldmines."

- **Scene-setting in one line**: Drop the reader into a moment.
  - "I just spent 2 days in London showing a $750M wealth management firm how to build a real media company."
  - "March 2020. Economy shifts overnight."

**What to avoid**: Starting with "In today's post..." or "I want to talk about..." or any variation of announcing what you're about to say instead of just saying it.

## 1A. Recognition-Based Hooks (Krishna's Frame)

**Critical shift:** Make ICP feel seen and understood, NOT judged or losing.

**The pattern:** Show them successful founders like them, or name a pattern they recognize in themselves. Empowering, not deflating.

**Before/After Examples:**

| ❌ Loss/Pain Frame (Avoid) | ✅ Recognition Frame (Use) |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| "You're paying $3,000/month for what costs me $200" | "Domain-expert founders are cutting ops costs by 90% without hiring developers" |
| "Your ops manager is wasting 15 hours/week" | "Here's how founders like you are reclaiming 15 hours/week from ops tasks" |
| "Most founders make this expensive mistake..." | "The pattern I keep seeing in successful consultancy founders..." |
| "You're probably doing this wrong..." | "Here's what domain-expert founders do differently when..." |
| "This is costing you clients every week" | "Here's how premium services founders are converting 30% more discovery calls" |

**The test:** Does the first line make ICP think "Yes, that's me" or "I'm failing"?

**Good recognition hooks:**
- "Domain-expert founders are [positive behavior]..."
- "Here's what successful [ICP archetype] do differently..."
- "The pattern I keep seeing in founders who [positive outcome]..."
- "Here's how [ICP archetype] are [positive action] without [common blocker]..."

**Why this works:** ICP sees themselves in a *winning* pattern, not a losing one. They lean in because they want to learn how to join that group, not because they feel attacked.

## 2. The Two-Founder Setup

Matt uses a comparison structure constantly — two people, same inputs, different outputs. It creates instant tension and makes the insight feel earned.

**Template:**
```
Two [type of person]. Same [variable 1]. Same [variable 2]. Same [variable 3].

[Person A] gets [mediocre outcome].

[Person B] gets [exceptional outcome].

The difference? [The insight you're about to teach.]
```

**Real examples:**
- "Two founders. Same expertise. Same content quality. Same posting frequency. Founder A builds 10,000 passive followers. Founder B builds 1,000 activated champions."
- "Two executive coaches. Same credentials. Same experience. Same city. Coach A struggles to differentiate. Coach B is recognized as a thought leader."

**Why it works**: It removes defensiveness. The reader doesn't feel attacked — they're watching two other people, and they self-select which one they are.

**Use this when**: The insight hinges on a mindset or approach shift, not just a tactic.

---

## 3. The Personal Confession Opener

When Matt shares a habit, mistake, or realization, he leads with self-implication before giving the lesson. This is what stops it from sounding like advice from above.

**Structure:**
1. "I used to [wrong behavior / mistaken belief]."
2. "Then [something happened / I realized something]."
3. "Here's what I learned."

**Real example:**
- "I used to think aiming for something realistic was smart. Until years ago, I sat down to set my revenue goals for Founder OS. And something weird happened. I couldn't shake the feeling that I was playing it safe. So I sat down… And wrote something that scared me. $10,000,000."

**The mechanics to copy:**
- Use short, punchy sentences after the setup — the rhythm slows down to mark importance.
- The ellipsis or line break before the scary number/realization is deliberate. It creates a pause.
- Never explain why you were wrong before showing you were wrong. Show first, explain second.

---

## 4. The "Here's a realization that cost me X" Frame

Matt regularly frames insights by attaching a price to them — time, money, or pain. This signals the insight is real, not theoretical.

**Templates:**
- "Here's a realization that cost me 3 years:"
- "I was working 80-hour weeks… Burned out and depressed… Convinced that if I just worked harder, we'd break through... I was wrong."
- "The breakthrough came when I stopped asking 'how do I do more?' And started asking 'what would have to be true to 10x this?'"

**Applied to thelaunch.space context**: When Krishna's blog insights translate to Valmiki posts, use this frame to attach real cost to the insight — not fake dramatic cost, but the actual time or money the wrong approach costs founders. Example: "I've seen founders spend $30K on an agency before realizing..." is better than "Many founders make the mistake of..."

---

## 5. Named Frameworks (Give Everything a Name)

Matt almost never leaves a concept unnamed. Every system, sequence, and approach gets a proper noun. This does two things: it's memorable, and it signals that this is a developed methodology, not an opinion.

**Examples from his emails:**
- Trust Acceleration Sequence
- Content GPS (Generate, Produce, Systematize)
- 10-3-1-90 Vision System
- The Movement Framework
- Industry Authority Playbook
- Community Leverage Secret
- Human-Centered Operations

**How to apply**: When Valmiki extracts an insight from a blog post, if the blog describes a process or framework — even informally — give it a name in the LinkedIn post.

Don't say: "There are three steps to validating your idea."
Say: "I call this the Domain Validation Loop — three steps that let you test demand before writing a line of code."

---

## 6. Anchor Numbers for Credibility

Matt uses specific numbers, not round ones. Specific numbers read as real; round numbers read as estimated.

**Pattern examples:**
- "3.7 seconds" (not "a few seconds")
- "$15,000 for a 47-page positioning document" (not "a lot of money for a long doc")
- "500,000+ people trying to make $100K/year. Maybe 50,000 trying to hit $1M. Less than 5,000 pursuing $10M."
- "Over 1,400 founders" (not "over a thousand founders")
- "15 years of experience" (not "decades of experience")

**Rule**: If you can cite a number from the original blog post (cost, time, percentage, user count), use the exact number in the LinkedIn post. It elevates the post from opinion to evidence.

---

## 7. The Highway / Metaphor Insert

Matt regularly inserts one concrete metaphor mid-argument to make the abstract visceral. He doesn't over-explain it — he lands it and moves on.

**Examples:**
- "Think about highway traffic for a second. Everyone merges into the same 2 lanes. The 'safe' lanes. The ones that look like they're moving. Meanwhile, the fast lane is wide open. Nobody believes they belong there. So nobody even tries."
- "Your brain is running at 3% battery." (from the evening checklist email)

**How to use this**: Pick one moment in the post where the core tension is highest, and insert a one-sentence scene or comparison. Don't explain the metaphor — just place it and let it land. Then return immediately to the argument.

---

## 8. The "Most Founders Do X. Here's the Trap." Structure

Matt has a recurring pattern for revealing a widespread mistake. The structure is: describe the behavior in a way that's familiar and relatable → label it as the trap → pivot to the correct approach.

**Template:**
```
Most [people] aim for [safe/comfortable thing].

They want [specific example of safe goal].

[These] feel "realistic."

Safe.

Achievable.

But here's the trap:

[Why the safe thing is actually harder / more costly]

[The correct reframe]
```

**Key mechanics**:
- The short stacked lines after "They want..." build a rhythm that feels like nodding agreement — then the pivot is a pattern interrupt.
- "But here's the trap:" is a near-literal construction he uses. It signals the frame shift clearly.
- The middle is where you validate the reader before correcting them. Never correct without validating first.

---

## 9. Case Study Format (The James/Sandra/Kyle Structure)

When Matt illustrates with a person, he follows a consistent arc:

1. **Setup**: "[Name] was a [role] with [surface-level success/problem]."
2. **The hidden gap**: "Despite [credentials/effort], [the actual problem they couldn't see]."
3. **The systematic fix**: Numbered phases or steps, each with a name.
4. **The outcome**: Described in terms of behavior change, not just results. (Not "he made more money" — "prospects began reaching out, conversations shifted...")
5. **The principle extracted**: One clean sentence that turns the case study into a universal lesson.

**Key detail**: Matt ends case studies with behavioral change, not revenue claims. This makes them feel credible and avoids the "success story" cliché. Model this: describe what changed in how people behaved toward the person, not what the person earned.

---

## 10. The Closing Challenge (Not a CTA)

Matt's posts rarely end with "follow me for more" or "drop a comment." They end with a directive that puts the ball in the reader's hand.

**Examples:**
- "Take your biggest goal right now. The one you've been telling yourself is the 'stretch' goal. Now 10x it. Write it down. Look at it every morning. And ask yourself: 'What would have to be true for this to happen?'"
- "Here's my challenge to you..."
- "The results will surprise you."

**Structure**: Verb → small concrete action → payoff promise.

For Valmiki, the closing should connect back to the specific blog the post was extracted from, offering the full depth as the natural next step — not as a "click here" pitch, but as a genuine "if this resonated, the full framework is at [URL]."

---

## 11. Sentence Rhythm Mechanics

Matt writes in a specific rhythm that alternates between long complex sentences and very short ones. The short sentences carry the emotional weight.

**Pattern:**
- Long setup sentence (provides context, builds tension).
- Short sentence. (lands the insight)
- Very short. (emphasis)
- Then slightly longer again to explain or expand.

**Example from his emails:**
> "I was working 80-hour weeks… Burned out and depressed… Convinced that if I just worked harder, we'd break through...
>
> I was wrong.
>
> The breakthrough came when I stopped asking 'how do I do more?'"

**For LinkedIn specifically**: The short sentences belong at the start of new lines / new visual breaks. On LinkedIn, a three-word sentence on its own line reads like a headline. Use this for the single most important line in the post.

---

## 12. Krishna's Voice Constraints (MANDATORY)

**⚠️ These override Matt Gray patterns when in conflict.**

### Negation-to-Pivot (Krishna HATES This)

**NEVER use negation just for drama:**

❌ **WRONG:**
- "It isn't code. It's specification."
- "These aren't technical questions. They're product questions."
- "The gap isn't X, it's Y."
- "This isn't just X, it's Y."

✅ **RIGHT:**
- "The gap between your idea and a working product is specification."
- "Product questions that most founders don't see coming..."

**Rule:** Only use negation if it adds actual value. Not to create false drama or pivots.

### Non-Conversational Guru Phrases

❌ **NEVER use:**
- "That's the unlock"
- "Here's the unlock"
- "This is the secret"
- "Game-changer" (in any form)

✅ **USE instead:**
- Natural conversation words
- What Krishna would actually say over coffee
- Simple, direct statements

**Test:** Would Krishna say this exact sentence to a founder friend over coffee? If not, rewrite it.

## 13. What Makes Writing Feel AI-Recycled (Avoid These)

Based on what Matt consistently avoids:

- **Filler transitions**: "In today's newsletter...", "Let's dive in", "Without further ado", "As I mentioned above"
- **Hedge stacking**: "It's important to note that", "Generally speaking", "In many cases"
- **Generic superlatives**: "game-changing", "revolutionary", "transformative" — these are noise. Use the specific outcome instead.
- **Passive voice for failure**: "Mistakes were made" → Matt says "I was wrong." Own it in first person.
- **Telling instead of showing the insight**: Don't say "this is a counterintuitive idea." Just state the counterintuitive idea. Let the reader feel the friction themselves.
- **Symmetrical lists**: Real humans don't give you exactly 5 things every time. Uneven lists (3 items, or 7 items) feel more honest than perfectly round numbers.

## Quick Reference: Post Anatomy

For a standard Valmiki LinkedIn post extracted from a blog:

| Section | Matt Gray Pattern | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|-------|
| Line 1 | Subverted expectation OR blunt diagnosis | No warm-up, no preamble |
| Lines 2–4 | Two-founder setup OR personal confession | Create tension before teaching |
| Middle | Named framework + anchor numbers + one metaphor | Give the insight a name; use real numbers from the blog |
| Pre-close | "Here's the trap" or case study outcome | Validate before correcting |
| Close | Challenge / directive | Specific action, not vague encouragement |
| Link (if any) | Natural reference to blog | "The full framework is at [URL]" — not "click here" |
