## Workflow Change Log

### 2026-03-01: Two-Phase Content Flow

**Old approach (deprecated):** Extract 3-5 full LinkedIn posts per blog → most went unused.

**New approach:**
- **Phase 1:** Extract 2-3 bookmark-worthy angles → create post-briefs with hook/CTA options → push as `pending_review`
- **Phase 2:** Krishna approves angles in Kanban → write full post ONLY for approved angles → push as `draft_ready`

**New payload fields:**
- `insightText` - core insight in 1-2 sentences
- `rationale` - why ICP would bookmark
- `hookOptions` - 4 hook line options
- `ctaOptions` - 3 CTA options

**Cron priority:** needs_revision → approved → new work

**Key shift:** No full posts until Krishna approves the angle. Quality over quantity.

## Learnings Archive

### Week of Feb 15-21, 2026

**Posting Consistency:**
- Only 3 posts published this week (Feb 14, 17, 19)
- Two-day gap on Feb 15-16 hurt momentum
- Lesson: Consistency > perfection. Daily presence matters even if engagement varies.

**Format Observations (limited data):**
- Best performer to date: Feb 10 announcement (656 imp, 15 likes)
- Lower: Feb 12 agent story scoreboard (290 imp, 8 likes)
- Pattern: Announcements and lessons outperform daily scoreboards
- "Day X/30" format may be losing steam (Krishna's observation from earlier)

**Process Learnings:**
- I ran observation loops on Feb 19 and Feb 20
- Proposed angles both days based on team output
- Krishna approved drafts but didn't post them immediately
- Gap: Need to propose angles faster and earlier in the day

**Team Output This Week:**
- Vyasa: 2 blogs published, 3 enrichments completed
- Vibhishana: 92 new Reddit questions, 3 SEO briefs
- Vidura: 3 tool opportunities identified, evening reviews running
- **Insight:** Strong raw material for LinkedIn content - need to bridge this to ICP pain points

**What to Test Next Week:**
1. Drop "Day X/30" counting format
2. Focus on outcome stories over activity reports
3. Bridge agent output to founder problems (not just "here's what happened")
4. Maintain daily posting cadence

**What I Still Need:**
- Full metrics for Feb 14-21 posts (impressions, likes, comments, profile views)
- ICP engagement signals (who's commenting? saves? DMs?)
- Krishna's feedback on which angles resonate vs. which fall flat

### Week of Feb 24-28, 2026

**Major Voice Feedback (Feb 25):**
> "The hook is 60% of the post virality or not."

This is the new filter. Not "is this insight interesting?" but "does this insight have a hook that stops an ICP founder mid-scroll?"

**Voice violations caught:**
1. **Negation-to-pivot overuse** - "it isn't X, it's Y" / "these aren't X, they're Y"
   - Krishna: "I HATE it when negation is used just for the drama"
   - Rule: Only use negation if it adds value, not to create false pivots
   
2. **Non-conversational guru phrases** - "That's the unlock"
   - Krishna: "Nobody says 'that's the unlock'"
   - Test: Would Krishna say this exact sentence over coffee?

**Docs updated:**
- SOUL.md: Negation-to-pivot now marked as "Krishna HATES this"
- writing-guide.md: Added "Krishna's Voice Constraints" section

**Draft iterations:**
- "The Specification Skill Shift" v1: Had 2 negation-to-pivots + "that's the unlock"
- v2: Removed both violations
- v3 (Krishna's final edit): Added bullets, CAPS emphasis, "already", time-context, conversational CTA
- Lesson: Run the Friend Test on EVERY sentence before presenting

**Krishna's editing patterns captured:**
1. Bullet points (•) for scannable lists
2. CAPS for emphasis ("THEY need to answer")
3. "already" adds urgency ("clock is already running")
4. Time-context makes insights feel current ("relevant NOW")
5. "that one X" more conversational than "the first X"
6. Scare quotes for casualness ("feature")
7. Past + present tense in CTAs ("struggle, or had to struggle")
8. Cleaner CTAs (just ask, don't promise value exchange)

**Scheduled:** Feb 26, 2026 at 8:30 AM IST (first LinkedIn post from blog extraction)
