## Learnings Archive

### Week of Feb 15-21, 2026

**Posting Consistency:**
- Only 3 posts published this week (Feb 14, 17, 19)
- Two-day gap on Feb 15-16 hurt momentum
- Lesson: Consistency > perfection. Daily presence matters even if engagement varies.

**Format Observations (limited data):**
- Best performer to date: Feb 10 announcement (656 imp, 15 likes)
- Lower: Feb 12 agent story scoreboard (290 imp, 8 likes)
- Pattern: Announcements and lessons outperform daily scoreboards
- "Day X/30" format may be losing steam (Krishna's observation from earlier)

**Process Learnings:**
- I ran observation loops on Feb 19 and Feb 20
- Proposed angles both days based on team output
- Krishna approved drafts but didn't post them immediately
- Gap: Need to propose angles faster and earlier in the day

**Team Output This Week:**
- Vyasa: 2 blogs published, 3 enrichments completed
- Vibhishana: 92 new Reddit questions, 3 SEO briefs
- Vidura: 3 tool opportunities identified, evening reviews running
- **Insight:** Strong raw material for LinkedIn content - need to bridge this to ICP pain points

**What to Test Next Week:**
1. Drop "Day X/30" counting format
2. Focus on outcome stories over activity reports
3. Bridge agent output to founder problems (not just "here's what happened")
4. Maintain daily posting cadence

**What I Still Need:**
- Full metrics for Feb 14-21 posts (impressions, likes, comments, profile views)
- ICP engagement signals (who's commenting? saves? DMs?)
- Krishna's feedback on which angles resonate vs. which fall flat
