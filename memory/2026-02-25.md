# 2026-02-25 - Memory Flush

## Feb 19-24 Summary (Session Spanning Multiple Days)

### Infrastructure Changes (Feb 19)
- OpenClaw updated v2026.2.2 → v2026.2.17
- Tailscale HTTPS enabled: `https://srv1331841.tail4447a0.ts.net/`
- Docker port locked to 127.0.0.1
- Container recreation WIPED workspace - all files restored from Krishna's local backup
- Root cause fix: Workspace now volume-mounted to VPS host

### Cron Delivery Fix (Feb 20)
- Identified "cron announce delivery failed" is an OpenClaw bug with channel ID resolution
- Workaround: Agents post manually via `message` tool (works), announce mechanism fails (noise)
- All 14 agent crons updated with self-contained Slack delivery

### Convex Field Name Fixes (Feb 20-22)
- Vyasa: Fixed `primaryKeyword` → `keyword` for `/ingestBlog`
- Vibhishana: Fixed `thelaunchspaceAngle` → `launchSpaceAngle` for `/upsertBrief`
- All 8 Convex endpoints tested and working

### Daily Context Backup (Feb 22)
- Cron created: 10 PM IST daily git push to `thelaunch-space/my-openclaw-agent-setup`
- .gitignore excludes: credentials/, node_modules/, vyasa/repo/, vyasa/drafts/, vyasa/app/
- Prevents future workspace wipes from losing agent work

### Live Feed Issue (Feb 22-24)
- Agents push to their own tables (questions, briefs, blogs) but NOT to `/ingestActivity`
- Live Feed on Launch Control stale since Feb 19
- Proposed fix: Option A (I push for all agents) or Option B (each agent pushes own activity)
- Still pending implementation

### Brief Content Wipe Incident (Feb 24)
- During dedup migration, 36 briefs lost content (upsert without contentMarkdown)
- Root cause: Upsert overwrites ALL fields; if contentMarkdown missing, content wiped
- Fix: Added guardrails to Vibhishana's AGENTS.md
- Remaining: 36 briefs with content intact

### Vibhishana Sheet Issue (Feb 23)
- Vibhishana couldn't add rows to blog-queue sheet
- Root cause: Didn't know about `vyasa-sheets-helper.js add-brief` command
- Fix pending: Update Vibhishana's AGENTS.md with exact add-brief instructions

### Vidura Cluster Column (Feb 23)
- Proposed adding column S "cluster" and column T "brief_source" to blog-queue
- Dropdown from topic-clusters pillarName
- Fix pending: I need to add columns to sheet

## Pending Action Items
1. Add cluster + brief_source columns to blog-queue sheet
2. Update Vibhishana AGENTS.md with `add-brief` command
3. Update Vidura AGENTS.md with Convex push instructions
4. Fix health check crons for Live Feed activity push
5. Implement Convex-side validation (reject briefs without contentMarkdown)

## Key Learnings
- Upsert is dangerous: ALWAYS include all required fields, especially contentMarkdown
- Announce delivery mode is broken for isolated sessions - use explicit message commands
- Git backup is essential insurance against workspace wipes
- Field name mismatches cause silent failures (Server Error with no detail)
