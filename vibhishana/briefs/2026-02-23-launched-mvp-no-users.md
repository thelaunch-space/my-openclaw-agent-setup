## What ICP Is Actually Asking

**Surface question:** "I launched my MVP but no one's using it. What do I do?"

**Real underlying problem:** "I did everything right (validated, built, launched) and I'm in the dead zone. I feel like a failure. Should I push harder or pivot? How do I know? And if I push, what EXACTLY do I do next—not generic advice like 'run 50 interviews,' but the first three actions?"

**Why this matters now:**
- Post-MVP is where 68% of startups die (not from lack of building, but from lack of traction)
- Founders hit the "dead zone" between shipping and scaling
- Generic advice (iterate! talk to users!) doesn't answer the core question: **push vs. pivot?**
- The rise of AI/no-code means MORE founders shipping MVPs faster, hitting this wall sooner
- Recent Reddit shows founders asking this weekly, feeling isolated

## Competitive Gap Analysis

### What Currently Ranks

**Top 5 results for "launched MVP no users":**

1. **Generic MVP troubleshooting guides** (Startup Bricks, FindNStart, Medium)
   - What they cover: 68% fail stat, feature creep warnings, MoSCoW prioritization
   - What's shallow: Checklist-driven, no emotional context, assumes you know what to prioritize
   - Example gap: "Run 20-50 customer interviews" - overwhelming, not tactical

2. **Product-centric iteration advice** (Atlassian, ProductPlan, Railsware)
   - What they cover: Gather feedback, analytics, retention cohorts
   - What's missing: **When to stop iterating and pivot?** All assume the idea is salvageable
   - Example gap: "Analyze cohorts" without explaining what signals mean "pivot now"

3. **Retention/PMF consultant frameworks** (Kalungi, PCD Consultancy, SaaStr)
   - What they cover: Technical debt, ICP refinement, T2D3 scaling
   - What's missing: Practitioner empathy, real examples, decision frameworks for solo founders
   - Example gap: "Build repeatable sales process" assumes you have sales to repeat

4. **Launch channel tactics** (Postiv.ai, T3C.ai, Dev.to)
   - What they cover: Product Hunt, Reddit, personal network, LinkedIn
   - What's shallow: "Launch playbook" assumes awareness is the problem, not product-market fit
   - Example gap: Doesn't address "I did all this and still no users"

5. **Build-in-public success stories** (Indie Hackers, HN)
   - What they cover: $570 MRR organic wins, community-driven growth
   - What's missing: Context for those who built in public and STILL got no traction

### What AI Tools (ChatGPT/Perplexity) Currently Cite

Queried Perplexity with: *"I launched my MVP but no one is using it. What should I do?"*

**What Perplexity cites:**
- Startup Bricks (generic mistakes)
- Atlassian (MVP definition)
- ProductPlan (iteration advice)
- Railsware (post-MVP roadmap)
- T3C.ai (100-user playbook)

**Why they're vague:**
- No **decision framework** for push vs. pivot
- No practitioner perspective (all consultant-written)
- No emotional/psychological guidance (founders feel like failures)
- Missing concrete "next 3 actions" (too high-level)

### Where Current Content Fails Practitioner-Level Depth

1. **No diagnostic for "when to pivot"** - all assume iteration is the answer
2. **Overwhelming advice** ("run 50 interviews") without prioritization
3. **Zero empathy for the psychological wall** - feeling stuck, judging yourself
4. **Missing the 4-week decision window** - how long to push before reassessing
5. **No real examples of founders in this exact spot** - only pre-launch or post-PMF stories

## thelaunch.space Angle (Our Unique Perspective)

**What we can say that no one else can:**

1. **Practitioner credibility:** Krishna's shipped 65+ MVPs, hit this wall dozens of times. Not theory—experience.

2. **The "dead zone" is normal, not failure:** You actually cleared the hardest gate (building). Most founders never ship. This is the next test.

3. **The 4-week decision framework:**
   - Week 1: Diagnostic (3 questions to ask first 5 users)
   - Week 2: Targeted iteration (pick ONE thing to fix)
   - Week 3: Outreach 2.0 (not spray-and-pray, but surgical)
   - Week 4: Pivot signal check (if X, pivot; if Y, push)

4. **Push vs. Pivot signals:**
   - **Pivot signals:** Users say "I like it but wouldn't pay," no retention after Day 3, you can't articulate the value prop in one sentence
   - **Push signals:** Users return but don't convert (friction problem), clear ICP but wrong channel, one power user loves it

5. **The $570 MRR blueprint:** What actually worked for the Reddit success story (communities > ads, personal replies, consistency)

6. **Non-dev perspective:** Technical overwhelm is REAL. When to rescue vs. when to rebuild.

## Suggested Structure

### H2: Introduction - You're Not Failing, You're in the Dead Zone
- Empathy opening: "You validated. You built. You launched. And now... crickets."
- Reframe: This is the second test, not failure
- Promise: Diagnostic framework to decide push vs. pivot in 4 weeks

### H2: Why "Launched MVP, No Users" Is the Real Validation Gate
- 90% of founders never ship (you cleared gate 1)
- 68% die post-MVP (this is gate 2)
- The "dead zone" explained (between shipping and scaling)

### H2: The 4-Week Decision Framework
#### H3: Week 1 - Diagnostic (3 Questions to Ask Your First 5 Users)
- Not "run 50 interviews" - be surgical
- The 3 questions: (1) What were you hoping this would do? (2) Why didn't you come back? (3) Would you pay $X?
- What you're listening for (retention signals vs. pivot signals)

#### H3: Week 2 - Targeted Iteration (Fix ONE Thing)
- Pick the highest-leverage fix from Week 1
- Examples: Onboarding friction, value prop clarity, missing feature
- Ship the fix, measure

#### H3: Week 3 - Outreach 2.0 (Surgical, Not Spray-and-Pray)
- If Week 2 showed improvement: Double down on working channel
- The $570 MRR blueprint (communities, personal replies, consistency)
- Avoid: Product Hunt if you're not ready, paid ads without retention

#### H3: Week 4 - Pivot Signal Check
- Decision table: If X, pivot; if Y, push
- Pivot signals: No retention, "like but won't pay," can't define ICP
- Push signals: Retention but no conversion, wrong channel, one power user

### H2: Push vs. Pivot Diagnostic Table
- Visual, scannable, bookmark-worthy
- Examples from real Reddit threads (sanitized)

### H2: What Actually Worked: The $570 MRR Case Study
- Solo founder, subscription tracker, 10-day ship
- Communities > ads, personal replies, daily metrics
- What to steal from this

### H2: When to Stop (The Failure Threshold)
- Specific metrics: <5% Day 3 retention, 0 paying intents after 10 asks
- Sunk cost fallacy warning
- Pivot with dignity (maintain relationships, archive learnings)

### H2: thelaunch.space POV - What We'd Do in Your Shoes
- Krishna's practitioner take
- When we'd pivot, when we'd push
- Offer: MVP rescue/assessment

- Related: "dead zone startup," "should I pivot or push startup"
