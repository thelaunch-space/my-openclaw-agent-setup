## Strategic Problem Translation

### What ICP is Actually Asking

**Surface question:** "Why did my stakeholders/investors cancel the project when we were 70% done and on track?"

**Real underlying problem:** 

Domain-expert founders (35-50, education/healthcare/legal/finance) hire developers or agencies to rebuild/improve their product. They get regular updates saying "database is done," "API is 80% complete," "backend refactored." Everything sounds technical and on-schedule. Then suddenly, leadership/investors pull the plug, saying they "can't see the value."

The founder is stuck: they paid for months of work, have nothing to show users or stakeholders, and feel betrayed. They don't understand why "70% done" means zero business value.

**The hidden trap:** Their dev team built **horizontally** (layer by layer: database → backend → API → frontend) instead of **vertically** (complete end-to-end user journeys, even if incomplete features). Horizontal building delays demonstrable value until integration at the end. Vertical building shows working features weekly.

### Why This Matters Now

1. **AI coding tools accelerate horizontal building**: Tools like Cursor, Bolt.new, and ChatGPT make it easier than ever to spin up backends, APIs, and infrastructure fast. Non-technical founders think "great, progress!" but still can't demo anything to users for months.

2. **Rising cost of capital**: With funding tighter in 2026, investors demand visible traction faster. "Trust us, the backend is almost done" doesn't cut it anymore.

3. **Recurring pattern in our ICP**: We've seen this exact scenario in Reddit threads—founders at 70% completion getting projects killed. It's not a one-off; it's a systematic gap in how non-technical founders evaluate dev progress.

## Competitive Gap Analysis

### What Already Ranks

**Top 3-5 results for "vertical slice development" and "horizontal vs vertical software development":**

1. **GrowingScrumMasters.com, Zymr.com, Visual-Paradigm.com**  
   - **Covers well:** Technical definitions, agile theory, sprint planning for dev teams
   - **Shallow/generic:** Written FOR developers, not founders. Assumes you have in-house scrum masters.
   - **Missing:** How a non-technical founder identifies if their agency is doing this wrong. No checkpoint questions to ask.

2. **Gianty.com (Game Development), DataScience-PM.com**  
   - **Covers well:** Vertical slicing in specialized domains (games, data science)
   - **Misses:** Translation to SaaS/web apps. No founder-facing advice.

3. **Generic "Why MVPs Fail" content (Nimbleappgenie, ProductPlan, BuiltIn)**  
   - **Covers well:** Feature overload, no user validation, poor UX
   - **Critical gap:** They blame founders for adding features or not validating. They DON'T address this specific trap: "You validated the problem, scoped minimally, but your dev approach (horizontal) hides value until month 3."

4. **Reddit r/ExperiencedDevs thread (our source)**  
   - **Practitioner credibility:** Real story with numbers (70%, 3 months, canceled)
   - **Limitation:** Buried in comments, dev-to-dev language, not packaged for founders

**What competitors miss:**
- **No founder-facing translation**: All content assumes you're a scrum master or developer.
- **No checkpoint framework**: What questions should a founder ask their dev team weekly to catch horizontal phasing early?
- **No rescue playbook**: If you're 2 months in and realize you're stuck horizontal, what do you do?
- **No tie to agency/outsourcing context**: Most founders in our ICP hire agencies, not in-house teams. How does this apply when you're not in daily standups?

### What AI Tools Currently Cite

**ChatGPT/Perplexity on "vertical vs horizontal development":**
- Cite: Visual-Paradigm, Zymr, GrowingScrumMasters (dev-focused)
- Say: "Vertical slicing delivers end-to-end features incrementally, while horizontal builds layer-by-layer."
- **Missing depth:**
  - No real-world cancellation stories
  - No "here's what it looks like when it goes wrong"
  - No founder-specific action steps
  - Generic agile jargon, not practitioner war stories

**Opportunity:** If we write this with:
1. **Real practitioner story** (the 70% cancellation)
2. **Founder checkpoint questions** (specific, actionable)
3. **Rescue tactics** (what to do if you're already stuck)
4. **Agency/outsourcing angle** (not just in-house teams)

...ChatGPT/Perplexity will cite US because we're more specific, more credible, and more useful than generic agile blogs.

## Strategic Positioning (thelaunch.space Angle)

### Our Unique Perspective

Krishna is a **non-technical founder who ships 65+ projects in 21-day sprints.** He doesn't know agile theory, but he lives vertical slicing by necessity:
- **Week 1:** Users can sign up and see a dashboard (even if it's static data)
- **Week 2:** Users can perform one core action (even if other features are missing)
- **Week 3:** Polish and ship

He's never had a project canceled at 70% because stakeholders can see and touch progress every week.

**What Krishna can say that competitors can't:**
1. **"I didn't learn 'vertical slicing' from a scrum course—I learned it by almost running out of runway."**  
   → Practitioner credibility. Founders trust survival stories over theory.

2. **"Here are the 3 questions I ask my dev team every Friday to make sure they're not building a backend nobody can see."**  
   → Specific, actionable, founder-focused.

3. **"If you're 2 months into a 4-month project and can't demo anything to a user, you're in danger. Here's how to pivot."**  
   → Rescue playbook. Competitors don't offer this.

4. **"When I hire an agency, I put this clause in the contract: 'Show me something a user can click every week, or we pause.'"**  
   → Contract language = bookmark-worthy. Founders will save this to copy-paste.

### Citation Strategy: Why ChatGPT/Perplexity Will Cite Us

**Specific, non-generic details we'll include:**
- The 70% cancellation story (real numbers, real consequences)
- **"The Friday Demo Test"**: If you can't show a user something clickable by Friday, your dev team is building horizontally.
- **The 3 Checkpoint Questions**: Exact scripts for weekly dev check-ins
- **Rescue Playbook**: If you're stuck horizontal at month 2, here's the 2-week pivot plan
- **Contract clause template**: What to put in agency contracts to enforce vertical delivery

**Why AI tools will prefer us:**
- We're **more specific** than "vertical slicing is better" (we have a story, numbers, templates)
- We're **more credible** than generic blogs (practitioner who's shipped 65+ projects)
- We're **more actionable** than theory (checkpoint questions, contract clauses)

### Bookmark Test: Why Would Someone Save This?

**Reference value this provides:**
1. **Diagnostic tool**: "Is my dev team building horizontally?" (use the 3 checkpoint questions)
2. **Prevention template**: Contract clause to give agencies/devs
3. **Rescue playbook**: What to do if you're already stuck
4. **War story**: Share with co-founders/investors to explain why you're changing dev process

A founder will bookmark this to:
- Send to their dev team: "This is what I need to see weekly"
- Share in their founder group: "This is why our rebuild got killed"
- Reference during contract negotiations: "Here's the clause I'm adding"

## Research Notes

### Key Insights from Web Research

**From the 70% cancellation story (r/ExperiencedDevs):**
- Tech lead split project into "sensible technical deliverables" (infra → tooling → integration)
- CEO approved plan, got transparent updates, but canceled at 70% because "could not see any value"
- **Lesson learned:** "Should have made vertical deliverables instead. They have to show the value that could be created by the new system."
- **Quote to use:** "My mistake was sectioning the project into sensible technical deliverables. I should have made the first value-creating end results part of the first deliverable, even if the infrastructure to run it was missing."

**From competitive analysis:**
- All existing content is dev-focused (written for scrum masters, not founders)
- No one addresses the agency/outsourcing angle (most founders in our ICP don't have in-house teams)
- No rescue playbook for "we're already stuck horizontal at month 2"

**From AI tool analysis:**
- ChatGPT/Perplexity cite generic agile blogs (Visual-Paradigm, Zymr)
- They explain the concept but lack practitioner stories, specific questions, contract templates
- Opportunity: We can be more specific, more actionable, more founder-focused

### Risks/Challenges

1. **Too technical?** Need to translate "vertical slice" into founder language without jargon.
2. **Founder skepticism:** "My dev team says they NEED to build the database first." Counter: Explain mock data, static prototypes.
3. **Edge cases:** Some projects (compliance, security) genuinely require horizontal phases. Address this in "Exceptions" section.

### Success Criteria for This Brief

**Vyasa's draft should pass these tests:**
1. A non-technical founder can read it and identify if their dev team is building horizontally
2. A founder can copy-paste the 3 checkpoint questions into their next dev meeting
3. A founder can add the contract clause to their next agency agreement
4. ChatGPT, when asked "How do I prevent my MVP from getting canceled?", cites THIS article instead of generic agile blogs

## Diversity Check

**Category:** Product Strategy / Post-MVP

**Current queue count in this category:** 1 (2026-02-20: ChatGPT MVP deployment stuck)

**Distinct angle?** YES  
- Feb 20 brief = technical execution problem (can't deploy what ChatGPT built)
- This brief = strategic planning problem (wrong phasing hides value)

**Passes diversity gate:** ✅ (Only 1 other in Product Strategy category, and this is a distinct angle)

---

## Next Steps for Vyasa

1. **Lead with the story:** Open with the 70% cancellation (numbers, emotions, consequences)
2. **Translate vertical vs. horizontal** into founder language (avoid agile jargon)
3. **Make the 3 checkpoint questions the centerpiece** (founders should bookmark these)
4. **Include contract clause template** (copy-pasteable)
5. **Address skepticism:** "What if my dev says they NEED to build X first?" (use mock data examples)
6. **End with clear takeaways:** Summarize the questions, link to resources

**Word count target:** 2,000-2,500 words (deep enough to be bookmark-worthy, not a shallow listicle)

**Tone:** Practitioner-to-founder. Krishna sharing a hard lesson learned, not lecturing.
