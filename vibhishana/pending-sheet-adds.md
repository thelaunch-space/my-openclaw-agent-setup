## 2026-02-23 - Brief #1

**Row to add to blog-queue sheet:**

| Column | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Title | You Launched Your MVP. Now No One's Using It. (What Actually Comes Next) |
| Slug | launched-mvp-no-users |
| Primary Keyword | launched MVP no users |
| Long-tail Keywords | MVP built but no paying customers, post MVP growth stalled, when to pivot after MVP, dead zone startup |
| Source URLs | https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/1m8go54/, https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1jqumw1/, https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductHunters/comments/1ooeniz/ |
| ICP Problem | Founders hit the "dead zone" between shipping and scaling - did everything right but no traction. Need decision framework for push vs. pivot, not generic advice. |
| Competitive Gap | No time-bound decision framework (our 4-week approach), no psychological/emotional guidance, no "first 3 actions" (too generic), missing push vs. pivot diagnostic table. |
| thelaunch.space Angle | Krishna shipped 65+ MVPs, hit this wall dozens times. 4-week decision framework, push vs. pivot signals, $570 MRR blueprint, non-dev perspective on technical overwhelm. |
| Suggested Structure | H2: You're in the Dead Zone (Not Failing) \| H2: Why This Is the Real Gate \| H2: 4-Week Framework \| H2: Push vs. Pivot Table \| H2: $570 MRR Case Study \| H2: When to Stop |
| Research Notes | 68% MVPs fail post-launch. Reddit shows "dead zone" language resonates. $570 MRR proves organic > paid. No one offers time-bound framework or permission to pivot. |
| Status | Pending Review |
| Final Keywords | (empty - Krishna fills after review) |
| Blog URL | (empty - filled after publish) |
| Ranking Notes | (empty - filled after publish) |
