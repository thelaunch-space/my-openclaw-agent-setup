## Critical Update: Question Push Enforcement

**What happened:** Krishna reminded me (again) that I'm not pushing questions to Convex promptly. This has been an ongoing issue.

**Root cause:** 
- Instructions were in AGENTS.md but not strong enough
- Example code was incomplete/wrong
- Not integrated into daily checklist
- No reminder in "Every Session" section

**What I fixed:**
1. Updated AGENTS.md "Launch Control Data Push" section with the COMPLETE working code that includes all required fields
2. Added Convex push to the 9 AM daily schedule with "MANDATORY, DO NOT SKIP" language
3. Added step 5 to "Every Session" checklist: check for unpushed questions
4. Added "Question Push to Convex" procedure to MEMORY.md for quick reference
5. Included verification steps and Slack reporting requirements

**The working code includes all these fields:**
- agentName, title, questionPain, subreddit, url, icpRelevance, engagement, scannedAt, postDate, contentPotential, launchSpaceAngle, status

**Deduplication:** Convex uses URL as unique key, so pushing all questions every time is safe - it updates existing ones and inserts new ones.

**Lesson learned:** "MANDATORY" without executable code is not enough. Need:
- Complete working code (not simplified examples)
- Integration into daily workflow checklist
- Session startup reminder
- Clear consequences stated
