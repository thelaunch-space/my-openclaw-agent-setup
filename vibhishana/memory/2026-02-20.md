## Morning Scan (9 AM IST)

**Scanner status:** Script failed - credential path issue (`/home/node/openclaw/vibhishana/credentials/` doesn't exist, should be `/home/node/openclaw/credentials/`). Used high-agency manual scanning with `web_search` + `web_fetch`.

### Questions Found (Bookmark-Worthy)

#### 1. "Tried Bolt.new, felt like a god, then reality" ⭐⭐⭐
- **Source:** r/nocode
- **URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/nocode/comments/1ii52d3/tried_boltnew_felt_like_a_god_then_reality/
- **Signal:** Failed DIY attempt (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Summary:** Non-dev used Bolt.new to generate full-stack app. Initial excitement ("AI is KING!"), then reality hit: "Where do I host this? Do I need Docker? Do I need a load balancer?" Ended up with "AI-powered anxiety." Realized they can't handle deployment, infrastructure, or maintenance.
- **ICP Fit:** Perfect - exactly the founder who tried AI tools and got stuck at 70%
- **Bookmark potential:** HIGH - reference material for "what happens after you build with AI"
- **Category:** Founder-Phase

#### 2. "Anyone else building with vibe coding and hitting walls?" ⭐⭐⭐
- **Source:** r/SaaS  
- **URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1mh1joc/anyone_else_building_with_vibe_coding_and_hitting/
- **Signal:** Failed DIY attempt (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Summary:** Non-technical solo founder building GPT-powered content automation. Started with Replit AI (integrations breaking), tried Bolt.new (smoother but same issues), explored Lovable, now looking at Cursor. Key pain: "one fix causing something else to crash" - cascading bugs across flows.
- **ICP Fit:** Excellent - tried multiple tools, still stuck, exactly needs thelaunch.space
- **Bookmark potential:** HIGH - pattern many are experiencing
- **Category:** Founder-Phase

#### 3. Lovable Authentication + Credit Loop Pattern ⭐⭐
- **Source:** r/nocode (multiple threads)
- **Signal:** Failed DIY, operations pain
- **Summary:** Pattern emerging: users escalate from $20→$50 subscriptions while stuck in circular debugging. "Lovable can't solve an authentication issue it created." Platform consumes credits attempting fixes that don't work. Community advice: "stop using Lovable to debug, use Claude instead."
- **ICP Fit:** Good - frustrated with AI tools, need human help
- **Bookmark potential:** MEDIUM - part of broader "AI tool reality" theme
- **Category:** Founder-Phase

#### 4. Technical Cofounder vs Dev Shop Debates ⭐⭐
- **Source:** r/ycombinator, r/entrepreneur, r/startups
- **URLs:** 
  - https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1cvn9yx/technical_cofounder_vs_offshore_dev_shop/
  - https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hevzy4/are_technical_cofounders_supposed_to_build_the/
- **Signal:** Dev disappeared, outsourcing pain
- **Summary:** Strong consensus against dev shops. Stories of 3x failures, late/buggy delivery, timezone issues. "Shops dig a hole if you say dig a hole without questioning." Advice: avoid dev shops, prioritize cofounder hunt or no-code validation.
- **ICP Fit:** Medium - validates market frustration, but "cofounder hunt" posts themselves are deprioritized
- **Bookmark potential:** MEDIUM - already heavily covered elsewhere
- **Category:** Founder-Phase

#### 5. SaaS Founder Hit $570 MRR in 30 Days (Organic) ⭐
- **Source:** r/ProductHunters
- **URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductHunters/comments/1ooeniz/solo_founder_here_hit_570_mrr_in_30_days_with_0/
- **Signal:** Success story (use as contrast/case study)
- **Summary:** Solo founder, subscription tracker app, $0 ad spend, community storytelling, personal replies. Tactics: "ship fast, human touch, community > ads"
- **ICP Fit:** N/A - success story, not pain point
- **Use for:** Case study reference in briefs
- **Category:** Distribution/GTM

### Briefs to Create Today (Ranked)

1. **"AI Built My App, Now What?"** (from Question #1 + #2)
   - Primary keyword: "how to deploy AI generated code"
   - Angle: thelaunch.space bridges the deployment gap
   
2. **"The Vibe Coding Reality Check"** (from Question #2 + #3)
   - Primary keyword: "vibe coding problems"
   - Angle: What to do when AI breaks your app across flows

### Action Items
- [ ] Brief #1 at 11 AM IST
- [ ] Brief #2 at 2 PM IST
- [ ] Report credential issue (scanner script path wrong)

### Notes
- Scanner script references wrong credential path. Should be `/home/node/openclaw/credentials/`, script looks in `/home/node/openclaw/vibhishana/credentials/`.
- High-agency manual scanning with `web_search` worked well.
- Strong pattern emerging: "vibe coding" / "AI-assisted building" frustration is widespread.
