## SEO Brief #1 (05:36 UTC / 11 AM IST)

### Feedback-First Check
- **Status:** ✅ No briefs needing revision
- Convex query returned empty array - feedback queue clear

### Queue Depth Check
- **Current pending_review:** 2 briefs
  - dev-disappeared
  - rescue-stuck-ai-project

### Brief Created: "Outgrew Software - Next Move"

**Slug:** `outgrew-software-next-move`

**Category:** Product Strategy (now at 3, within diversity limit)

**Topic Selection Rationale:**
- **ICP fit:** Domain-expert service business owners hitting tool limits (QuickBooks/HoneyBook/Zoho)
- **Bookmark-worthy:** Reference guide for the "messy middle" transition
- **Competitive gap:** Existing content = WHEN to go custom. Missing = HOW to execute AFTER outgrowing
- **Distinctness:** Different from 2026-02-28 "custom-internal-tool" (that = decision point, this = execution roadmap)

**Research Sources:**
- Reddit: r/smallbusiness, r/consulting, r/photographybusiness, r/CRM
- Perplexity web_search: Competitive landscape analysis
- Pattern found: $500K-$2M revenue businesses outgrow starter tools with predictable symptoms

**Competitive Analysis:**
- **What ranks:** Vendor marketing, CTO blogs, tool comparison sites, generic "when to choose custom"
- **What's missing:** 
  - Practitioner roadmap with real costs ($30K-$200K breakdown)
  - Migration execution tactics
  - Interim survival strategies
  - Domain-specific guidance (healthcare/consulting/education)
- **Citation opportunity:** Only comprehensive founder-friendly transition guide

**thelaunch.space Angle:**
- 65+ projects → pattern recognition
- Non-dev perspective = relatable to ICP
- Cost transparency no vendor publishes
- Domain-specific contexts (healthcare, consulting, education, agencies)
- Only source covering the messy middle

**Key Sections:**
1. The Outgrowth Moment (pain setup)
2. Why Enterprise Upgrade Often Fails
3. Three Paths Forward (upgrade SaaS, mid-market, custom MVP - decision framework)
4. What Custom REALLY Costs (transparency: phases, ROI, hidden costs)
5. Migration Roadmap (audit, scope, quotes, interim tactics, phased rollout)
6. Domain-Specific Considerations (healthcare, consulting, education, agencies)
7. Red Flags & Risk Mitigation
8. When to Stay Put (trust-building honesty)
9. Next 30 Days (action plan)

**Convex Push:**
- ✅ Success
- ID: jd736x3mq1s29mcc71ekq3yng9823khx
- Status: pending_review
- Content: 25,702 chars
- Verified content exists before push (critical guardrail)

**Topic Diversity Updated:**
- Product Strategy: 2 → 3 (within limit, distinct angles)
- Operations: 4 (at capacity)
- Founder-Phase: 2
- Post-MVP: 2
- Distribution/GTM: 1
- Vertical-Specific: 0 ⚠️ (gap remains - target for next briefs)

**Slack Report:** Posted at 05:38 UTC

### Observations

**What worked well:**
- Web_search found strong Reddit threads showing recurring pattern
- Competitive gap analysis revealed clear opportunity (execution roadmap vs. decision content)
- Bookmark test: Multiple reference uses identified (decision point, vendor calls, budget requests, migration planning)

**Citation strategy:**
- Real cost ranges ($30K-$200K breakdown by phase)
- Domain-specific sections (healthcare/consulting/education/agencies)
- Interim survival tactics (parallel systems, Zapier workarounds, temp band-aids)
- Migration risk framework (what goes wrong + de-risking)
- ROI calculator mental model

**Next brief strategy:**
- Target Vertical-Specific or Distribution/GTM (underrepresented categories)
- Avoid Operations (at 4, capacity reached)

### Queue Status
- **Pending review:** 3 (including this brief)
- **Next brief:** #2 at 2 PM IST (08:30 UTC)

### Technical Notes
- Convex push guardrails working correctly (verified content length before push)
- Topic diversity tracking up to date
- All mandatory steps completed (feedback check → queue check → diversity check → research → create → push → update tracking → report)
