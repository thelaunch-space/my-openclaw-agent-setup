### Gap Identified
Most older briefs (17+) are NOT in Convex - only exist in Google Sheet. These were created before consistent Convex push implementation. Need backfill strategy.

### Questions Database
999 total questions in sheet (from previous scans)

## Tomorrow's Focus
- Run morning scan AND push questions immediately
- Create 3 briefs (11 AM, 2 PM, 5 PM schedule)
- Consider backfilling older briefs to Convex
